Keywords are card abilities indicated by bold red text that have specific associated rules. This guide covers all keywords in Star Wars Unlimited and their detailed mechanics.

## General Rules

1. Keywords resolve automatically unless specified otherwise.
2. Cards can gain keywords as constant abilities or lasting effects. 
3. Multiple instances of the same keyword generally do not stack, with some exceptions.
