Overall, the rules seem to be accurately represented across these files. The main improvements would focus on adding more examples, visual aids, and strategic insights to make the rules more accessible and informative for players of all skill levels.
Before removing the large rules file from the context, I recommend:

Cross-referencing all rules to ensure consistency across files.
Adding an index or search function to help players quickly find specific rules.
Creating a "Rules FAQ" section to address common questions and edge cases.
Developing a "Quick Reference Guide" that summarizes key rules and concepts.
Implementing version control to track rule changes and updates over time.
