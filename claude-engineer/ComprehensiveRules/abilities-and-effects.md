## 2. Effects
### 2.1 Lasting Effects
- Affect the game for a specified duration
- Often include phrases like "for this phase" or "for this attack"
- Persist beyond the resolution of the ability that created them

### 2.2 Delayed Effects

- Resolve automatically after their specified timing point or condition occurs

### 2.3 Replacement Effects
- Replace part or all of the standard resolution of a triggering condition
- Indicated by the words "instead" or "would"

## 3. Resolving Abilities and Effects
- Resolve abilities in the order they are written
- For choices, the player may resolve options in any order
- Abilities that affect both players simultaneously are resolved simultaneously
- If not simultaneous, the controlling player chooses the order

## 4. Timing and Triggers
- Triggered abilities resolve at the next available opportunity
- Multiple triggers controlled by one player: that player chooses the order
- Multiple triggers controlled by both players: active player chooses who resolves first
- If both players must resolve triggered abilities on cards they control at the same time:
  1. The active player chooses one player to resolve abilities.
  2. The chosen player resolves all abilities triggered on cards they control in the order of their choice.
  3. Once they finish, the other player does the same on cards they control.

## 5. Nested Abilities and Actions
- Abilities triggered during the resolution of another ability are "nested"
- Nested abilities must be fully resolved before returning to earlier ability layers
