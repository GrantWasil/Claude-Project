## A. Types of Abilities

### A.1. Action Abilities
- Indicated by the bolded word "Action" or "Epic Action"
- Usually have a cost in brackets
- Using an action ability counts as the player's action for the turn (see [Player Actions](player-actions.md))
- Example: "Action [Exhaust]: Deal 1 damage to a unit."

### A.2. Constant Abilities
- Always in effect while the card is in play
- Don't have any special styling
- Remain in effect even if the card is [exhausted](game-concepts.md#5-ready-and-exhausted)
- Example: "While this unit is undamaged, it has Sentinel."

### A.3. Event Abilities
- Found in the text box of [event cards](card-types.md#2-event)
- Resolved when the event is played
- Example: "Deal 2 damage to each unit in the ground arena."

### A.4. Keyword Abilities
- Indicated with bold red text
- Have specific associated rules
- Examples: Ambush, Grit, Overwhelm, Raid, Restore, Saboteur, Sentinel, Shielded
- For detailed explanations, see the [Keywords](keywords.md) section

### A.5. Triggered Abilities
- Have bold text indicating their triggering condition
- Start with "When" or "On", followed by a colon and an effect
- Examples: "When Played", "When Defeated", "On Attack"
- Example: "When Defeated: Draw a card."

## B. Effects

### B.1. Lasting Effects
- Affect the game for a specified duration
- Often include phrases like "for this phase" or "for this attack"
- Persist beyond the resolution of the ability that created them
- Example: "This unit gets +2/+2 for this phase."

### B.2. Delayed Effects
- Created when an ability indicates a future timing point or condition
- Resolve automatically after their specified timing point or condition occurs
- Example: "At the start of your next turn, draw a card."

### B.3. Replacement Effects
- Replace part or all of the standard resolution of a triggering condition
- Indicated by the words "instead" or "would"
- Example: "If this unit would be defeated, instead heal all damage from it."

## C. Resolving Abilities and Effects
- Resolve abilities in the order they are written
- For choices, the player may resolve options in any order
- Abilities that affect both players simultaneously are resolved simultaneously
- If not simultaneous, the controlling player chooses the order

## D. Timing and Triggers
- Triggered abilities resolve at the next available opportunity
- Multiple triggers controlled by one player: that player chooses the order
- Multiple triggers controlled by both players: active player chooses who resolves first
- If both players must resolve triggered abilities on cards they control at the same time:
  1. The active player chooses one player to resolve abilities.
  2. The chosen player resolves all abilities triggered on cards they control in the order of their choice.
  3. Once they finish, the other player does the same on cards they control.
- If an ability instructs a player to "ignore" a keyword ability or aspect penalty:
  - For keywords: Treat the ignored ability as inactive for the specified duration
  - For aspect penalty: Pay the cost of the card without adding the aspect penalty, but the card still retains its aspect icons

## E. Nested Abilities and Actions
- Abilities triggered during the resolution of another ability are "nested"
- Nested abilities must be fully resolved before returning to earlier ability layers
- Example: 
  1. Player A plays a card that defeats an enemy unit. 
  2. The defeated unit has a "When Defeated" ability that triggers.
  3. This "When Defeated" ability is resolved before any other abilities that triggered from the initial card play.
