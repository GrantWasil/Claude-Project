## 1. General Concepts
1.1. Star Wars Unlimited is typically a two-player card game, but can be played with more players using multiplayer rules.

1.2. Players need one deck each, an initiative counter, damage counters, and token cards matching any types created by their decks.

1.3. There is no maximum number of cards a deck can have. The minimum number of cards varies by format.
   - For example, in the Premier format, a deck must contain exactly 1 leader, exactly 1 base, and a minimum of 50 other cards (consisting of units, events, and upgrades).

1.4. Leaders and bases are part of a deck for deckbuilding but are not considered part of a deck during gameplay.

1.5. Tokens are not part of a player's deck and don't count toward deck size.

1.6. Players may include cards from any aspect in their deck, even if they don't match their leader/base aspects (though playing these cards may incur the aspect penalty).

## 2. Golden Rules
2.1. If the text of a card directly contradicts the text of the Comprehensive Rules, the text of the card takes precedence.

2.2. While resolving a card ability, resolve as much of the ability as possible, and ignore any parts of the ability that cannot be resolved.

2.3. In case of a conflict between a restrictive ability and a permissive ability, the restriction takes precedence.

## 3. Players and Active Player
3.1. The active player is the player that is currently taking an action.

3.2. Players take turns being the active player during the action phase.

3.3. The first active player in a game is the player that started the game with the initiative counter.

3.4. If no player is currently taking an action, such as during the regroup phase, the player with the initiative counter is considered to be the active player.

## 4. Card Ownership and Control
4.1. A player is the "owner" of a card that started the game in their deck. This includes the deck's leader, base, and any events, units, and upgrades that started the game in that deck. A player is also the "owner" of any tokens they put into play.

4.2. A player is the "controller" of a card they put into play. This includes their base, their leader, resources in their resource zone, and units, upgrades, and tokens they play or put into play.

4.3. While a player controls a card, they may resolve action abilities on the card, attack with the card if it is a unit, and affect it with abilities that affect "friendly" cards.

4.4. If an ability instructs a player to "take control" of a card, that player will become that card's controller, and remain so until either that card leaves play or their opponent takes control of that card.

## 5. Ready and Exhausted
5.1. A card is considered "ready" when it is turned upright. A card is considered "exhausted" when it is turned sideways (rotated 90 degrees).

5.2. Each non-leader unit and resource enters play exhausted. Upgrades are neither ready nor exhausted.

5.3. When a Leader Unit is deployed, it enters the ground arena ready, even if it was exhausted before.

5.4. Exhausted cards ready through certain card abilities, or during the regroup phase each round.

5.5. A ready unit must exhaust when starting an attack, or when paying the cost of an action ability on it that uses a ↷ icon.

## 6. Defeating Cards
6.1. Cards that are in-play, including bases, tokens, units, upgrades, and resources, can be defeated.

6.2. A base is defeated when it has damage on it equal to or greater its HP. When a base is defeated, its owner loses the game.

6.3. A unit is defeated when it has damage on it equal to or greater than its HP, or when an ability defeats it directly. When a non-leader unit is defeated, it is moved to its owner's discard pile.

6.4. When a leader unit is defeated, it is flipped to its Leader side and moved to its owner's base zone, exhausted.

6.5. An upgrade is defeated when the unit it is attached to leaves play, or when an ability defeats it directly. When an upgrade is defeated, it is moved to its owner's discard pile.

6.6. When a token is defeated, it is set aside out-of-play.

6.7. When a resource is defeated, it is moved to its owner's discard pile faceup.

## 7. Aspects and Unique Cards
7.1. Aspects
- There are six aspects: Vigilance ![Image 1: Vigilance Aspect](https://swudb.com/images/Vigilance.png), Command ![Image 2: Command Aspect](https://swudb.com/images/Command.png), Aggression ![Image 3: Aggression Aspect](https://swudb.com/images/Aggression.png), Cunning ![Image 4: Cunning Aspect](https://swudb.com/images/Cunning.png), Villainy ![Image 5: Villainy Aspect](https://swudb.com/images/Villainy.png), and Heroism ![Image 6: Heroism Aspect](https://swudb.com/images/Heroism.png).
- Players incur an aspect penalty when playing cards with aspects not provided by their leader or base.
- The aspect penalty is 2 additional resources for each missing aspect icon.

7.2. Unique Cards
- Unique cards are indicated by a ⟡ symbol before their name.
- A player can only control one copy of each unique card at a time.
- If a player would control a second copy of a unique card, they must immediately defeat one copy.

## 8. Resources and Costs
8.1. A resource is a game object used to pay the costs of cards and certain abilities. A card becomes a resource when placed into a player's resource zone.

8.2. When paying a card's cost or the cost of an ability that uses a {R} icon, a player must exhaust ready resources they control equal to the number indicated by the cost.

8.3. Players can choose to add a card from their hand to their resource zone during each regroup phase.

8.4. Some abilities allow players to put cards into play as resources outside of the regroup phase.

8.5. A card's cost can be modified through abilities. Any modifiers to a card's cost must be taken into account when paying for the cost of a card.

## 9. Damage and HP
9.1. Cards with HP values (units and bases) can be dealt damage by attacks and abilities. Damage dealt is represented by damage counters.

9.2. When damage is dealt to a card, place that many damage counters on that card.

9.3. When damage is healed from a card, remove that many damage counters from that card.

9.4. Damage is persistent. Damage counters remain on cards until either the card leaves play, or the damage is healed.

9.5. If a unit has damage on it equal to or greater than its HP value, that unit is immediately defeated.

9.6. If a base has damage on it equal to or greater than its HP value, its owner immediately loses the game, and their opponent wins the game.

## 10. Power
10.1. Power represents the amount of damage a unit deals during combat.

10.2. A unit's power can be modified by upgrades attached to it, or through certain card abilities.

10.3. A card's power cannot be modified below 0. If a card's power would be modified below 0, treat the card's power as 0 instead.

## 11. Game State
11.1. "The game state" refers to: each card's current zone, controller, attributes, and status (ready/exhausted and faceup/facedown); the initiative counter's controller and status (taken/available); the status of open and hidden information for a player; the status of all active lasting effects and delayed effects; and the status of **Epic Action** abilities (used/unused).

11.2. A player must change the game state when they take any action other than passing during their turn.

## 12. Open and Hidden Information
12.1. "Open information" refers to information that any player is entitled to know. This includes the attributes of faceup cards in play, the number of counters on cards, the number of cards in each player's hand and deck, the cards in each player's discard pile, and the reverse side of each player's leader.

12.2. "Hidden information" refers to information that has restrictions on when it can be known, and by whom. This includes the order of cards in each player's deck and cards in a player's hand or resources.
