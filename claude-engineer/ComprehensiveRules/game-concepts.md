# Star Wars Unlimited: Game Concepts

## 1. General Concepts
- Star Wars Unlimited is a two-player card game (unless otherwise specified).
- Players need one deck each, an initiative counter, damage counters, and token cards.
- There is no maximum number of cards a deck can have. The minimum number of cards varies by format.
  - For example, in the Premier format, a deck must contain exactly 1 leader, exactly 1 base, and exactly 50 other cards (consisting of units, events, and upgrades).
- Leaders and bases are part of a deck for deckbuilding but not during gameplay.
- Tokens are not part of a player's deck and don't count toward deck size.
- Players may include cards from any aspect in their deck, even if they don't match their leader/base aspects (though playing these cards may incur the aspect penalty).

## 2. Golden Rules
- Card text takes precedence over the Comprehensive Rules.
- When resolving an ability, do as much as you can and ignore parts that can't be resolved.
- Restrictions override permissions.

## 3. Players and Turn Structure
- The active player is the one currently taking an action.
- Players alternate being the active player during the action phase.
- The first active player starts with the initiative counter.
- If no player is taking an action, the player with the initiative counter is considered the active player.

## 4. Card Ownership and Control
- A player owns cards that started in their deck and tokens they put into play.
- A player controls cards they put into play until they leave play or an opponent takes control.
- While controlling a card, a player may use its abilities, attack with it if it's a unit, and affect it with "friendly" card abilities.
- Taking control of a card maintains its status (ready/exhausted, damage, upgrades).

## 5. Ready and Exhausted
- Cards are either ready (upright) or exhausted (sideways).
- Non-leader units and resources enter play exhausted.
- Exhausted cards ready during the regroup phase or through abilities.
- Ready units must exhaust to attack or pay certain ability costs.

## 6. Defeating Cards
- Cards in play can be defeated when they have damage equal to or greater than their HP, or when an ability defeats them directly.
- When a non-leader unit is defeated, it goes to its owner's discard pile.
- When a leader unit is defeated, it flips to its Leader side and moves to its owner's base zone, exhausted.
- When an upgrade is defeated, it goes to its owner's discard pile.
- When a token is defeated, it is set aside out-of-play.
- When a resource is defeated, it goes to its owner's discard pile faceup.
