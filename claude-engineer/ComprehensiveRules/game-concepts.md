## 1. General Concepts
1.1. Star Wars Unlimited is a two-player card game (unless otherwise specified for [multiplayer rules](multiplayer-rules.md)).

1.2. Players need one deck each, an initiative counter, damage counters, and token cards.

1.3. There is no maximum number of cards a deck can have. The minimum number of cards varies by format.
   - For example, in the Premier format, a deck must contain exactly 1 [leader](card-types.md#3-leader), exactly 1 [base](card-types.md#1-base), and a minimum of 50 other cards (consisting of [units](card-types.md#4-unit), [events](card-types.md#2-event), and [upgrades](card-types.md#5-upgrade)).

1.4. Leaders and bases are part of a deck for deckbuilding but not during gameplay.

1.5. Tokens are not part of a player's deck and don't count toward deck size.

1.6. Players may include cards from any aspect in their deck, even if they don't match their leader/base aspects (though playing these cards may incur the aspect penalty).

## 2. Golden Rules
2.1. Card text takes precedence over the Comprehensive Rules.

2.2. When resolving an ability, do as much as you can and ignore parts that can't be resolved.

2.3. Restrictions override permissions.

## 3. Players and Turn Structure
3.1. The active player is the one currently taking an action.

3.2. Players alternate being the active player during the [action phase](turn-structure.md#2-action-phase).

3.3. The first active player starts with the initiative counter.

3.4. If no player is taking an action, the player with the initiative counter is considered the active player.

## 4. Card Ownership and Control
4.1. A player owns cards that started in their deck and tokens they put into play.

4.2. A player controls cards they put into play until they leave play or an opponent takes control.

4.3. While controlling a card, a player may use its abilities, attack with it if it's a unit, and affect it with "friendly" card abilities.

4.4. Taking control of a card maintains its status (ready/exhausted, damage, upgrades).

## 5. Ready and Exhausted
[Content remains unchanged]

## 6. Defeating Cards
6.1. Cards in play can be defeated when they have damage equal to or greater than their HP, or when an ability defeats them directly.

6.2. When a non-leader unit is defeated, it goes to its owner's [discard pile](game-zones.md#g-discard-pile).

6.3. When a leader unit is defeated, it flips to its Leader side and moves to its owner's [base zone](game-zones.md#a-base-zone), exhausted.

6.4. When an upgrade is defeated, it goes to its owner's discard pile.

6.5. When a token is defeated, it is set aside out-of-play.

6.6. When a resource is defeated, it goes to its owner's discard pile faceup.

## 7. Aspects and Unique Cards
7.1. Aspects
- There are six aspects: Vigilance, Command, Aggression, Cunning, Villainy, and Heroism.
- Players incur an aspect penalty when playing cards with aspects not provided by their leader or base.
- The aspect penalty is 2 additional resources for each missing aspect icon.

Examples of Aspect Penalty:
- If your leader and base provide Vigilance and Command, playing a card with only Aggression would cost 2 additional resources.
- If your leader and base provide Vigilance, Command, and Aggression, playing a card with Cunning and Villainy would cost 2 additional resources (only one aspect is missing).
- If your leader and base provide Vigilance and Command, playing a card with Heroism and Villainy would cost 4 additional resources (two aspects are missing).

Strategic Considerations:
- Including off-aspect cards in your deck can provide powerful options but at a higher cost.
- Cards without aspects can be played without incurring the aspect penalty, making them versatile choices for any deck.
- Some cards or abilities may reduce or negate the aspect penalty, allowing for more flexible deck building.

7.2. Unique Cards
- Unique cards are indicated by a ⟡ symbol before their name.
- A player can only control one copy of each unique card at a time.
- If a player would control a second copy of a unique card, they must immediately defeat one copy.

7.3. Play vs. Put into Play
- "Play" means to use a card from hand by paying its cost and following standard play rules.
- "Put into play" means to move a card into play without paying its cost or triggering "When Played" abilities.

## 8. Resources and Costs
8.1. Resources are cards placed facedown in a player's [resource zone](game-zones.md#d-resource-zone).

8.2. To play a card or use certain abilities, a player must exhaust a number of ready resources equal to the cost.

8.3. Players can add one card from their hand to their resource zone during the regroup phase.

8.4. Some abilities allow players to put cards into play as resources outside of the regroup phase.

8.5. The printed cost of a card can be modified by various effects, including the aspect penalty.

## 9. Strategic Resource Management

9.1. Resource Curve
- Consider the distribution of card costs in your deck to ensure a smooth "resource curve."
- Aim for a balance of low-cost cards for early game and high-impact, higher-cost cards for later turns.

9.2. Resource Development
- Decide each turn whether to play a card or add it to your resource zone.
- Adding resources consistently can provide long-term advantages but may sacrifice short-term board presence.

9.3. Aspect Management
- When deck building, consider the aspect penalty costs for off-aspect cards.
- During gameplay, weigh the benefits of playing an off-aspect card against the additional resource cost.

9.4. Card Economy
- Some cards allow you to draw additional cards or put resources into play.
- These effects can accelerate your game plan and should be used strategically.

9.5. Timing and Sequencing
- Plan your resource usage carefully, considering both your current turn and future turns.
- Sometimes it's beneficial to hold resources for reactive plays during your opponent's turn.

9.6. Resource Denial
- Some cards or abilities can destroy or exhaust your opponent's resources.
- Using these effects at crucial moments can disrupt your opponent's strategy.
