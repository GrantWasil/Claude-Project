## A. Base Zone
- Each player has their own base zone.
- Located in the center of their play area.
- Contains the player's [base](card-types.md#1-base) and [leader](card-types.md#3-leader) (when not deployed).
- Units in either arena may attack enemy bases directly without leaving their arena.

Example: "Death Star" base card starts in the base zone. When a player uses their leader's Epic Action to deploy, the leader moves from the base zone to the ground arena.

Strategic Implications:
- Protecting your base is crucial as its destruction leads to defeat.
- Some bases have powerful abilities that can be activated from this zone, influencing your overall strategy.
- The base zone's central location makes it vulnerable to attacks from both arenas, requiring careful defense planning.

## B. Ground Arena
- Shared zone for both players.
- Located next to each player's base zone.
- Ground units are played into this zone.
- Ground units can attack enemy ground units or the enemy base.
- Cannot attack enemy units in the space arena unless an ability allows it.

Example: A "Stormtrooper Squad" unit card is played from hand into the ground arena. It can then attack enemy ground units or the enemy base, but not space units.

Strategic Implications:
- Control of the ground arena can prevent direct attacks on your base from enemy ground units.
- Some units have abilities that specifically interact with other ground units, making this arena crucial for certain strategies.
- Balancing your presence in both arenas is key to a well-rounded defense and offense.

## C. Space Arena
- Shared zone for both players.
- Located next to each player's base zone.
- Space units are played into this zone.
- Space units can attack enemy space units or the enemy base.
- Cannot attack enemy units in the ground arena unless an ability allows it.

Example: An "X-wing Starfighter" unit card is played from hand into the space arena. It can attack enemy space units or the enemy base, but not ground units.

Strategic Implications:
- Controlling the space arena can prevent direct attacks on your base from enemy space units.
- Space units often have unique abilities that can influence the game in ways ground units cannot.
- Neglecting either arena can leave you vulnerable, so consider your deck composition carefully.

## D. Resource Zone
- Each player has their own resource zone.
- Contains cards used as resources to pay costs.
- Resources are placed facedown.
- A player may view their own resources at any time.
- Players can add a card from their hand to their resource zone during each [regroup phase](turn-structure.md#3-regroup-phase).

Example: During the regroup phase, a player chooses to place a card from their hand facedown in their resource zone instead of playing it. This card can now be used to pay for costs on future turns.

Strategic Implications:
- Balancing resource development with playing cards is crucial for long-term success.
- Some cards allow you to put additional resources into play, potentially accelerating your game plan.
- Knowing when to build resources versus developing your board state is a key skill in the game.

## E. Deck
- Each player's deck is its own zone.
- Cards are facedown and out of play.
- Cannot be viewed except through abilities.
- Cards leave the deck when drawn, discarded, or played directly from the deck.
- If a player would draw from an empty deck, they deal 3 damage to their base for each card they would draw.

Example: A card ability states "Look at the top 3 cards of your deck. You may play one of them." This allows interaction with the deck zone.

Strategic Implications:
- Deck construction is crucial as it determines what cards you'll have access to during the game.
- Cards that allow you to search your deck or play cards from it can provide significant advantages.
- Managing your deck size and draw effects is important to avoid self-damage from an empty deck.

## F. Hand
- Each player's hand is its own zone.
- No limit to the number of cards in hand.
- Cards enter the hand when drawn or returned from another zone.
- Cards leave the hand when played or discarded.
- A player may only look at their own hand.
- The number of cards in a player's hand is open information.

Example: At the end of a turn, a player draws two cards, moving them from their deck to their hand.

Strategic Implications:
- Hand size can indicate a player's options and potential threats.
- Some abilities force opponents to discard from their hand, potentially disrupting their plans.
- Managing your hand size through card draw and strategic play is key to maintaining flexibility.

## G. Discard Pile
- Each player's discard pile is its own zone.
- Contains played [events](card-types.md#2-event), defeated (non-leader) [units](card-types.md#4-unit), defeated [upgrades](card-types.md#5-upgrade), and discarded cards.
- Cards are placed faceup.
- Open information that can be viewed by any player at any time.
- The order of cards in a discard pile does not need to be maintained.

Example: After a "Force Lightning" event card is played and resolved, it's placed in the discard pile.

Strategic Implications:
- The discard pile can be a resource for cards with abilities that interact with it.
- Knowing what's in your opponent's discard pile can inform you about their deck composition and what threats have been neutralized.
- Some strategies revolve around retrieving cards from the discard pile or using it as a resource.

## H. In-Play and Out-of-Play
- In-play zones: base zone, ground arena, space arena, and resource zone.
- Out-of-play zones: deck, hand, and discard pile.
- Cards in out-of-play zones can't affect the game unless specified.
- Abilities that affect out-of-play zones must explicitly state the zone they affect.

## I. Play Area
- A player's play area consists of cards they control in in-play zones.
- Includes: cards in base zone, resource zone, controlled units in arenas, and upgrades on controlled units.
- Excludes: upgrades on enemy units (even if controlled by the player).
- There is no limit to the number of cards a player can control in their play area.

## J. Set Aside
- Cards that are set aside are out-of-play and not in any zone.
- [Token](card-types.md#6-token) cards begin the game set aside.
- Set aside cards can only be interacted with through specific card abilities.
