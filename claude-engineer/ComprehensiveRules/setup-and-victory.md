# Star Wars Unlimited: Setup and Victory Conditions

## Game Setup
1. Put bases into play: Each player places their base at the top and center of their own play area.

2. Put leaders into play: Each player places their leader into play below their base, Leader side faceup.

3. Determine the first player: Randomly choose a player. That player decides which player begins the game with the initiative counter.

4. Shuffle decks and draw opening hands: Each player shuffles their deck, then draws 6 cards.

5. Choose whether to take a mulligan: Each player may take one mulligan by shuffling their entire hand into their deck and drawing a new hand of 6 cards. The player with the initiative decides first.

6. Resource two cards: Each player chooses two cards from their hand and puts them into play as resources, facedown and ready.

7. Begin the first round with the first action phase.

## Victory Conditions
The game ends immediately when one of the following conditions is met:

1. Base Destruction: If a player's base reaches 0 remaining HP and is defeated, that player loses the game, and their opponent wins.

2. Concession: A player can concede the game at any time, immediately losing the game.

3. Empty Deck: If a player would draw a card from their empty deck, they instead deal 3 damage to their base for each card they would draw. If this causes their base to reach 0 HP, they lose the game.

4. Simultaneous Base Destruction: In the case where both players' bases reach 0 remaining HP at the same time, the game ends in a draw.

Note: Once a player's base has 0 remaining HP, they cannot take any actions, and cannot resolve any abilities or effects.
