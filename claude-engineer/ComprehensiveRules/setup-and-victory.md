2. [Victory Conditions](#victory-conditions)

## 1. Game Setup
1.1. **Put bases into play**: Each player places their [base](card-types.md#bases) at the top and center of their own [play area](game-zones.md#play-area).

1.2. **Put leaders into play**: Each player places their [leader](card-types.md#leaders) into play below their base, Leader side faceup.

1.3. **Determine the first player**: Randomly choose a player. That player decides which player begins the game with the [initiative counter](game-concepts.md#initiative-counter).

1.4. **Shuffle decks and draw opening hands**: Each player shuffles their [deck](game-zones.md#deck), then draws 6 cards.

1.5. **Choose whether to take a mulligan**: Each player may take one mulligan by shuffling their entire hand into their deck and drawing a new hand of 6 cards. The player with the initiative decides first.

1.6. **Resource two cards**: Each player chooses two cards from their hand and puts them into play as [resources](game-concepts.md#resources), facedown and [ready](game-concepts.md#ready-and-exhausted).

1.7. **Begin the first round**: Start with the first [action phase](turn-structure.md#2-action-phase).

## 2. Victory Conditions
The game ends immediately when one of the following conditions is met:

2.1. **Base Destruction**: If a player's base reaches 0 remaining HP and is defeated, that player loses the game, and their opponent wins.

2.2. **Concession**: A player can concede the game at any time, immediately losing the game.

2.3. **Empty Deck**: If a player would draw a card from their empty deck, they instead deal 3 damage to their base for each card they would draw. If this causes their base to reach 0 HP, they lose the game.

2.4. **Simultaneous Base Destruction**: In the case where both players' bases reach 0 remaining HP at the same time, the game ends in a draw.

**Note**: Once a player's base has 0 remaining HP, they cannot take any actions, and cannot resolve any abilities or effects.
