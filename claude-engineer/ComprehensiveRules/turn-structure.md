## 1. Round Structure
1.1. A round consists of two phases: Action Phase and Regroup Phase.

1.2. The start of each Action Phase marks the beginning of a new game round.

### 2.2 Player Turns
- Players alternate taking one action at a time.
- The player with the [initiative counter](game-concepts.md#3-players-and-turn-structure) is the first active player.
- After an action and any triggered abilities resolve, the opponent becomes the active player.
- Players can take one of five actions during their turn:
  1. [Play a Card](player-actions.md#a-play-a-card)
  2. [Attack With a Unit](player-actions.md#b-attack-with-a-unit)
  3. [Use an Action Ability](player-actions.md#c-use-an-action-ability)
  4. [Take the Initiative](player-actions.md#d-take-the-initiative)
  5. [Pass](player-actions.md#e-pass)

### 2.3 End of Action Phase
- The phase ends when both players pass consecutively.

### 3.1 Start of Regroup Phase
- Lasting effects that expire at the start of the regroup phase expire now.
- Abilities that trigger at the start of the regroup phase trigger now.

### 3.2 Draw Cards
- Each player draws 2 cards from their [deck](game-zones.md#e-deck).

### 3.3 Resource Cards

- Players may choose not to resource a card.

### 3.4 Ready Cards

## 6. Strategic Considerations

### Action Phase
1. **Resource Management**: Balance between playing cards and saving resources for reactions.
2. **Board Control**: Decide whether to focus on removing enemy units or developing your own board state.
3. **Initiative Timing**: Choose the right moment to take the initiative for the next round.
4. **Bluffing**: Pass with playable cards to bait your opponent into overcommitting.
5. **Sequencing**: Order your actions to maximize synergies and minimize your opponent's counterplay options.

Example: You have a unit with "When Played" ability and another with an action ability. Consider playing the unit first to benefit from its ability before using the action ability of the other unit.

### Regroup Phase
1. **Card Selection**: When adding a resource, consider whether the card might be more valuable in hand.
2. **Hand Size Management**: If you're near the maximum hand size, consider using more cards before drawing.
3. **Resource Development**: Balance between adding resources for long-term advantage and keeping powerful cards in hand.
4. **Anticipating Next Round**: Ready your cards with your first action of the next round in mind.

Example: If you have a powerful event card, you might choose to add a different card as a resource to keep the event available for the next round.

## 7. Timing and Sequencing of Actions

The order in which you take actions can significantly impact the game. Consider the following:

1. **Baiting Responses**: Play less important cards first to bait out your opponent's responses before playing your key cards.

2. **Maximizing "When Played" Abilities**: If you have multiple units with "When Played" abilities, consider the optimal order to play them.

3. **Setting Up Combos**: Sometimes it's better to play supporting cards before your main threat to ensure it has maximum impact.

4. **Reacting to Opponent's Plays**: Save reactive cards or abilities for after your opponent has committed their resources.

5. **End of Phase Timing**: Remember that some effects last until the end of the phase. Time your actions to maximize benefit from these effects.

Example Sequence:
1. Play a unit with "When Played: Deal 1 damage to an enemy unit."
2. Use this to weaken an enemy unit.
3. Then attack with one of your units to defeat the weakened enemy unit.
4. Finally, play a powerful unit into the now-cleared board position.

By carefully considering the timing and sequence of your actions, you can create powerful turns that your opponent may struggle to counter.
