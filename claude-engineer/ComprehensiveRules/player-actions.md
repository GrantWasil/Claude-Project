During the [Action Phase](turn-structure.md#2-action-phase), players can take one of five actions on their turn:

## A. Play a Card
1. Choose a card from hand (or another zone if specified by an ability).
2. Pay the card's cost in [resources](game-zones.md#d-resource-zone), accounting for any modifiers.
3. Put the card into play ([unit](card-types.md#4-unit) or [upgrade](card-types.md#5-upgrade)) or resolve its ability ([event](card-types.md#2-event)).
4. Resolve any "When Played" [triggered abilities](abilities-and-effects.md#a5-triggered-abilities).

Example: Playing a unit card
- Choose a unit card from your hand
- Pay its cost by exhausting the required number of resources
- Place the unit in the appropriate arena (ground or space)
- Resolve any "When Played" abilities on the unit

## B. Attack With a Unit
1. Choose and exhaust a [ready](game-concepts.md#5-ready-and-exhausted) unit to be the attacker.
2. Choose a target: an enemy unit in the same [arena](game-zones.md#b-ground-arena) or the opponent's [base](game-zones.md#a-base-zone).
3. Resolve any "On Attack" [triggered abilities](abilities-and-effects.md#a5-triggered-abilities).
4. Deal combat damage simultaneously (attacker to defender/base, defender to attacker).
5. Resolve any "When Defeated" abilities for [defeated](game-concepts.md#6-defeating-cards) units.
6. Complete the attack and resolve any relevant abilities.

Example: Attacking with a unit
- Exhaust your 3/2 unit to attack an opponent's 2/3 unit
- Resolve any "On Attack" abilities
- Deal 3 damage to the enemy unit and receive 2 damage
- The enemy unit is defeated; resolve its "When Defeated" ability if it has one

## C. Use an Action Ability
1. Choose a card with an [action ability](abilities-and-effects.md#a1-action-abilities).
2. Pay the ability's cost (if any).
3. Resolve the ability's effect.

Example: Using an action ability
- Choose a unit with the ability "Action [Exhaust]: Deal 1 damage to a unit"
- Exhaust the unit to pay the cost
- Choose a target unit and deal 1 damage to it

## D. Take the Initiative
1. Take control of the initiative counter.
2. Flip the initiative counter to its "taken" side.
3. After taking the initiative, the player cannot use their turn to take any further actions for the rest of that round's action phase.
4. The player is considered to have "passed," and they automatically "pass" for all remaining turns they would take that phase.
5. Only one player can take this action per round.

Example: Taking the initiative
- Decide to take the initiative during your turn
- Take control of the initiative counter and flip it to its "taken" side
- You cannot take any more actions this phase, but you will go first next round

## E. Pass
- Declare that you are passing your turn.
- You may pass even if other actions are available.
- When both players pass consecutively, the Action Phase ends.

Example: Passing
- Decide to pass your turn, even if you have playable cards or available actions
- If your opponent also passes on their next turn, the Action Phase ends

## F. Important Notes
- Players must change the game state when they take any action other than passing during their turn. If a chosen action would not change the game state, a player must choose a different action to take or pass.
- Some abilities allow players to take actions outside of their turn or as nested actions.
- Players cannot take more than one action per turn unless specified by a card ability.
- [Ambush](keywords.md#a-ambush) allows a unit to attack as a nested action when played.
- [Epic Action](abilities-and-effects.md#a1-action-abilities) abilities can only be used once per game.
