During the [Action Phase](turn-structure.md#2-action-phase), players can take one of five actions on their turn:

## A. Play a Card
- Choose a card from hand (or another zone if specified by an ability).
- Pay the card's cost in [resources](game-zones.md#d-resource-zone), accounting for any modifiers.
- Put the card into play ([unit](card-types.md#4-unit) or [upgrade](card-types.md#5-upgrade)) or resolve its ability ([event](card-types.md#2-event)).
- Resolve any "When Played" [triggered abilities](abilities-and-effects.md#a5-triggered-abilities).

## B. Attack With a Unit
- Choose and exhaust a [ready](game-concepts.md#5-ready-and-exhausted) unit to be the attacker.
- Choose a target: an enemy unit in the same [arena](game-zones.md#b-ground-arena) or the opponent's [base](game-zones.md#a-base-zone).
- Resolve any "On Attack" [triggered abilities](abilities-and-effects.md#a5-triggered-abilities).
- Deal combat damage simultaneously (attacker to defender/base, defender to attacker).
- Resolve any "When Defeated" abilities for [defeated](game-concepts.md#6-defeating-cards) units.
- Complete the attack and resolve any relevant abilities.

## C. Use an Action Ability
- Choose a card with an [action ability](abilities-and-effects.md#a1-action-abilities).
- Pay the ability's cost (if any).
- Resolve the ability's effect.

## D. Take the Initiative
- Take control of the initiative counter.
- Flip the initiative counter to its "taken" side.
- After taking the initiative, the player cannot use their turn to take any further actions for the rest of that round's action phase.
- The player is considered to have "passed," and they automatically "pass" for all remaining turns they would take that phase.
- Only one player can take this action per round.

## E. Pass
- Declare that you are passing your turn.
- You may pass even if other actions are available.
- When both players pass consecutively, the Action Phase ends.

## F. Important Notes
- Players must change the game state when they take any action other than passing during their turn. If a chosen action would not change the game state, a player must choose a different action to take or pass.
- Some abilities allow players to take actions outside of their turn or as nested actions.
- Players cannot take more than one action per turn unless specified by a card ability.
