# Star Wars Unlimited: Player Actions

During the Action Phase, players can take one of five actions on their turn:

## 1. Play a Card
- Choose a card from hand (or another zone if specified by an ability).
- Pay the card's cost in resources, accounting for any modifiers.
- Put the card into play (unit or upgrade) or resolve its ability (event).
- Resolve any "When Played" abilities.

## 2. Attack With a Unit
- Choose and exhaust a ready unit to be the attacker.
- Choose a target: an enemy unit in the same arena or the opponent's base.
- Resolve any "On Attack" abilities.
- Deal combat damage simultaneously (attacker to defender/base, defender to attacker).
- Resolve any "When Defeated" abilities for defeated units.
- Complete the attack and resolve any relevant abilities.

## 3. Use an Action Ability
- Choose a card with an action ability.
- Pay the ability's cost (if any).
- Resolve the ability's effect.

## 4. Take the Initiative
- Take control of the initiative counter.
- Flip the initiative counter to its "taken" side.
- After taking the initiative, the player cannot use their turn to take any further actions for the rest of that round's action phase.
- The player is considered to have "passed," and they automatically "pass" for all remaining turns they would take that phase.
- Only one player can take this action per round.

## 5. Pass
- Declare that you are passing your turn.
- You may pass even if other actions are available.
- When both players pass consecutively, the Action Phase ends.

Important Notes:
- Players must change the game state when they take any action other than passing during their turn. If a chosen action would not change the game state, a player must choose a different action to take or pass.
- Some abilities allow players to take actions outside of their turn or as nested actions.
- Players cannot take more than one action per turn unless specified by a card ability.
