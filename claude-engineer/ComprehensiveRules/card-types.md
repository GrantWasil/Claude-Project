## 1. Base
1.1. Represents a location in Star Wars.
1.2. Each deck must have exactly 1 base.
1.3. Starts the game in the owner's [base zone](game-zones.md#base-zone).
1.4. Can be dealt damage through abilities and enemy attacks.
1.5. When a base has no remaining HP, its owner loses the game (see [Victory Conditions](setup-and-victory.md#2-victory-conditions)).

Examples and Strategic Uses:
- "Death Star": A base with high HP (40) and the ability "Action: Deal 1 damage to each enemy unit." Strategic use: Provides longevity and board control.
- "Rebel Base on Hoth": A base with moderate HP (30) and the ability "When an enemy unit attacks your base, exhaust it." Strategic use: Discourages direct attacks on your base.
- "Coruscant Senate": A base with lower HP (25) but the ability "At the start of your turn, gain 1 additional Force." Strategic use: Accelerates your Force generation for faster card deployment.

## 2. Event

2.2. To play: pay its cost, place it in the [discard pile](game-zones.md#discard-pile), then resolve its ability.
2.3. Does not enter play; moves directly from hand to discard pile.
2.4. Can affect itself if it affects cards in the discard pile.

Examples and Strategic Uses:
- "Force Lightning": Cost 3, "Deal 2 damage to up to 3 different enemy units." Strategic use: Efficient multi-target removal.

## 3. Leader

3.5. When deployed, flips to Leader Unit side and moves to the ground arena, [ready](game-concepts.md#5-ready-and-exhausted).
3.6. When defeated as a Leader Unit, flips back to Leader side and moves to the base zone, exhausted.

Examples and Strategic Uses:
- "X-wing Starfighter": Cost 3, 3/3, Space, Pilot. "When this unit attacks, it gets +1 power for this attack for each other friendly Pilot unit." Strategic use: Synergizes with other Pilot units for increased damage output.

## 5. Upgrade

5.5. No limit to the number of upgrades that can be attached to a unit.
5.6. Can be played on friendly or enemy units.
5.7. If a player plays an upgrade onto an enemy unit, that player still [controls](game-concepts.md#4-card-ownership-and-control) the upgrade. If that upgrade gives abilities to the attached unit, the unit's controller resolves those abilities.
5.8. Defeated when the attached unit leaves play or when an ability defeats it directly.
5.9. Some upgrades are also tokens and have the "token upgrade" card type.

Examples and Strategic Uses:
- "Lightsaber": Cost 2, +2/+1. "Attached unit gains Overwhelm 1." Strategic use: Improves unit's combat effectiveness and provides additional base damage.
- "Stealth Field Generator": Cost 3, +0/+2. "Attached unit cannot be targeted by enemy events or abilities." Strategic use: Protects key units from removal effects.
- "Rebel Armor": Cost 1, +0/+2. "When attached unit would be defeated, instead remove all damage from it and defeat this upgrade." Strategic use: Provides additional durability to important units.

## 8. Card Interactions

Understanding how different card types interact is crucial for mastering Star Wars Unlimited. Here are some key interactions:

8.1. Units and Upgrades:
- Multiple upgrades can be attached to a single unit, potentially creating powerful combinations.
- Upgrades that give abilities to units can create synergies with the unit's existing abilities.
- Example: A "Blaster Rifle" upgrade (+1/+0, "Attached unit gains 'Action: Deal 1 damage to target unit.'") on a unit with the ability "When this unit deals damage, draw a card" creates a powerful action economy.

8.2. Leaders and Other Cards:
- Leader abilities often synergize with specific card types or traits.
- Example: A leader with "Friendly Droid units get +1/+1" encourages building a deck with many Droid units.

8.3. Events and Units:
- Events can often target units for various effects, such as dealing damage, moving units, or granting temporary bonuses.
- Some units have abilities that trigger when targeted by events, creating interesting counterplay opportunities.
- Example: An event "Deal 3 damage to target unit" against a unit with "When this unit would be dealt damage, you may discard a card to prevent 2 of that damage."

8.4. Bases and Other Card Types:
- Some units, upgrades, or events may have abilities that specifically interact with bases.
- These interactions can be crucial for both offensive and defensive strategies.
- Example: An upgrade "When attached unit damages the enemy base, gain 1 Force" can create a powerful economic engine.

8.5. Tokens and Regular Cards:
- Tokens often interact with regular cards through abilities that create or manipulate tokens.
- Understanding these interactions can provide additional strategic depth.
- Example: A unit with "When this unit enters play, create two Shield tokens and attach them to this unit" provides built-in protection.

Understanding these interactions allows players to create powerful combos, anticipate opponent's plays, and make more informed decisions during deck building and gameplay.
