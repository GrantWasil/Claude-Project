## 1. General
1.1. A card's type is located in the top left corner of the card. There are 6 different types of cards: bases, events, leaders, units, upgrades, and tokens.

1.2. A "resource" is not a type of card, but a game object that a card becomes when placed in the [resource zone](game-zones.md#resource-zone).

## 2. Base
2.1. A base represents a location in Star Wars.

2.2. Each base has a name, trait(s), HP value, and aspect icon. Some bases also have an ability.

2.3. Each player's deck must have exactly 1 base. Each base begins the game in its owner's [base zone](game-zones.md#base-zone).

2.4. Bases can be dealt damage through abilities and enemy attacks. Unless prevented by an ability, any unit can attack an enemy base directly.

2.5. Some abilities heal damage from a base, such as the [Restore](keywords.md#restore) keyword. A base cannot be healed beyond its HP value.

2.6. When a base has no remaining HP, its owner immediately loses the game, and its opponent immediately wins the game. For more details, see the [Setup and Victory](setup-and-victory.md) section.

## 3. Event
3.1. An event is a type of card with a name, cost, trait(s), and ability. An event may also have aspect icons.

3.2. To play an event, pay its cost and place it in its owner's [discard pile](game-zones.md#discard-pile). Then, resolve the event's ability.

3.3. When played, an event moves directly from the player's hand to their discard pile, never entering play.

3.4. An event that affects cards in a player's discard pile can affect itself.

3.5. When resolving an event ability, resolve as much of the ability as possible and ignore anything that cannot resolve. For more details on resolving abilities, see the [Abilities and Effects](abilities-and-effects.md) section.

## 4. Leader
4.1. A leader is a double-sided card with a horizontal "Leader side" and a vertical "Leader Unit side." Each side of a leader has two aspect icons, a name, subtitle, trait(s), and abilities.

4.2. Each player's deck must have exactly 1 leader. Each leader begins the game in the base zone on its Leader side.

4.3. A leader is deployed using the **Epic Action** ability on its Leader side. When deployed, flip it to its Leader Unit side and move it to the [ground arena](game-zones.md#arenas), ready.

4.4. When a Leader Unit has no remaining HP, it is defeated: flip it to its Leader side and move it to its owner's base zone, exhausted.

4.5. If an ability would cause a Leader Unit to move to an out-of-play zone or change control for any reason, it is defeated instead.

## 5. Unit
5.1. A unit is a type of card depicting a Star Wars character or vehicle. Each unit has a name, cost, power, HP, trait(s), and arena type. A unit may also have a subtitle, aspect icons, abilities, and a unique icon (⟡) before its name.

5.2. To play a unit, pay its cost and place the unit in its designated arena (ground or space).

5.3. A unit enters play exhausted and remains in play until it is defeated.

5.4. A unit is defeated when it has no remaining HP or when an ability defeats it directly. When a unit is defeated, place it in its owner's discard pile.

5.5. Leader Units are a type of unit. Leader Units have the same rules as non-leader units, except that they are deployed instead of being played, and they are returned to the base zone instead of being discarded.

## 6. Upgrade
6.1. An upgrade is a type of card that attaches to a unit. Each upgrade has a name, cost, trait(s), power modifier, and HP modifier. An upgrade may also have aspect icons, abilities, and a unique icon (⟡) before its name.

6.2. To play an upgrade, pay the upgrade's cost and attach it to a unit in play.

6.3. An upgrade may specify that it must "attach to" a specific type of unit. This is considered a play restriction for that upgrade.

6.4. There is no limit to the number of upgrades that can be attached to a unit.

6.5. Upgrades may be played on friendly units or enemy units. If a player plays an upgrade onto an enemy unit, that player still controls the upgrade.

6.6. Each upgrade has a power modifier and HP modifier. A unit's power and HP are cumulatively modified by each upgrade attached to it.

6.7. An upgrade is defeated when either the unit it is attached to leaves play, or when an ability defeats it directly.

## 7. Token
7.1. A token is a type of card that also has a second type, such as a "token upgrade."

7.2. Tokens are set aside at the start of the game. They cannot be shuffled into decks, cannot be discarded, and are not considered "played" when they enter play.

7.3. If a token would move to an out-of-play zone for any reason, set it aside instead.

7.4. There is no limit on tokens available to a player. A player may substitute any available object (such as dice) for a token.

7.5. An Experience token is a type of token upgrade that gives the unit it is attached to +1 power and +1 HP.

7.6. A [Shield](keywords.md#shield) token is a type of token upgrade that prevents the next instance of damage that would be dealt to the attached unit.
