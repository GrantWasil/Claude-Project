## 1. General
1.1. Star Wars Unlimited can be played using several different game formats. This section describes multiplayer formats, which are for games with more than two players, usually three or four.

1.2. Multiplayer games can be played with decks created with either constructed or limited rules.

1.3. Unless otherwise specified, all rules in the Comprehensive Rules apply to all multiplayer formats.

## 2. Gameplay Overview
2.1. Setting up a multiplayer format game is the same as setting up a two-player game, with the adjustment that each player chooses in clockwise order whether or not to take a mulliganâ€”the active player is the first to decide, then the next player clockwise from them decides, and so on. For more details on game setup, see the [Setup and Victory](setup-and-victory.md) section.

2.2. For the [ground arena and space arena](game-zones.md#arenas), each player has a portion of each arena contained to their play area, where each player has a ground arena portion on one side of their base zone, and a space arena portion on the other side. Each player's portion of an arena is considered part of the larger arena.

2.3. The player that starts a round with the initiative is the first active player and takes the first action. Then, the next player clockwise from the first player becomes the new active player and takes an action. Play continues this way until the end of the action phase. For more information on turn structure, see the [Turn Structure](turn-structure.md) section.

2.4. Once each player has passed consecutively, the action phase ends.

## 3. Player Elimination
3.1. Once a player's base has no remaining HP, that player is eliminated from the game and they cannot take any more actions. All cards they own are removed from play and any cards owned by other players in their play area are placed in their owners' [discard piles](game-zones.md#discard-pile). (The removed cards are not considered defeated or discarded, and do not cause abilities to trigger.) Any of their triggered abilities still waiting to resolve are ignored.

3.2. An eliminated player cannot be brought back into play; their base cannot be healed, and they cannot be affected by abilities.

3.3. If an eliminated player created a [lasting effect or delayed effect](abilities-and-effects.md#3-effects) earlier in the round they were eliminated, that effect remains active in the game, and the remaining players must resolve it as completely as possible.

3.4. If an eliminated player controlled the initiative counter, return the initiative counter to the center of the game area, "available" side faceup. It can then be taken by a different player.

## 4. Additional Clarifications
4.1. There are no rules dictating how players may converse with one another in a game. Players may discuss potential actions, open information, and hidden information freely. Any deals made between players are not binding.

4.2. For the purposes of card abilities, a player's "opponent" is any one of the other players in the game, and a player's "opponents" is each other player in the game. Even if a player makes a deal with another player, they are still "opponents" to each other for the purposes of card abilities that affect opponents.

4.3. If an ability that affects multiple players can be resolved simultaneously, resolve that ability simultaneously. Otherwise, the player that controls the card with the ability can choose the order in which each player is affected by the ability.

4.4. A unit with [Sentinel](keywords.md#sentinel) only prevents units in the same arena from attacking its controller's non-Sentinel units or base. It does not prevent one opponent's units from attacking another opponent's non-Sentinel units or base.
