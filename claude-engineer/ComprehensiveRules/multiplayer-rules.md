## A. General Rules
- Multiplayer games can be played with constructed or limited decks.
- All standard rules apply unless otherwise specified.
- Recommended for 3-4 players, but can accommodate more with adjusted rules.

## B. Setup
- Players choose whether to mulligan in clockwise order, starting with the active player.
- Each player has a portion of the [ground and space arenas](game-zones.md#b-ground-arena) in their play area.
- Determine seating order randomly.

## C. Gameplay
- The player with the initiative is the first active player.
- Play proceeds clockwise.
- The [action phase](turn-structure.md#2-action-phase) ends when each player has passed consecutively.
- Combat between non-adjacent players is allowed but may have restrictions based on card text.

## D. Player Elimination
- When a player's [base](game-zones.md#a-base-zone) has no remaining HP, they are eliminated.
- All cards they own are removed from play.
- Cards owned by other players in their play area go to their owners' [discard piles](game-zones.md#g-discard-pile).
- Eliminated players' [triggered abilities](abilities-and-effects.md#a5-triggered-abilities) are ignored.
- [Lasting effects](abilities-and-effects.md#b1-lasting-effects) created by eliminated players remain active for the round.
- If a player eliminates another player (such as by being the last player to damage the eliminated player's base), they immediately heal 5 damage from their own base.

## E. Initiative
- If an eliminated player controlled the initiative counter, return it to the center.
- The next player clockwise from the eliminated player gains control of the initiative counter.

## F. Additional Rules
- Players may freely discuss the game, but deals are not binding.
- For card abilities, "opponent" refers to any other player, and "opponents" refers to each other player.
- Abilities affecting multiple players resolve simultaneously if possible, otherwise in an order chosen by the active player.
- [Sentinel](keywords.md#h-sentinel) only prevents attacks on its controller's units and base, not attacks between other players.
- For [Bounty](keywords.md#b-bounty) abilities in multiplayer games, the opponent who defeats/captures a unit with Bounty must be chosen as the opponent who may collect that Bounty.
- Area-of-effect abilities (e.g., "deal 1 damage to each unit") affect all applicable targets, regardless of controller.

## G. Twin Suns Format
- Special multiplayer format with unique rules.
- Each deck has two [leaders](card-types.md#3-leader) sharing either the Heroism or Villainy aspect.
- Only one copy of each card allowed in the deck.
- Uses additional blast and plan counters:
  - Blast counter: When taken, deal 1 damage to each opponent's base.
  - Plan counter: When taken, draw 1 card, then place 1 card from hand on the bottom of your deck.
- Players take an Available Counter action instead of [Take the Initiative](player-actions.md#d-take-the-initiative).
- Game ends when one player is eliminated; player with most remaining HP wins.
- Detailed Twin Suns rules:
  1. Setup: Place blast and plan counters in the center along with the initiative counter.
  2. During the action phase, players may take the "Take an Available Counter" action.
  3. A player can only take one counter per round.
  4. After taking a counter, a player passes for the rest of the action phase.
  5. The action phase ends when all counters are taken or all players have passed.
