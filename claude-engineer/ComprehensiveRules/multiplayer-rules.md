# Star Wars Unlimited: Multiplayer Rules

## General Rules
- Multiplayer games can be played with constructed or limited decks.
- All standard rules apply unless otherwise specified.

## Setup
- Players choose whether to mulligan in clockwise order, starting with the active player.
- Each player has a portion of the ground and space arenas in their play area.

## Gameplay
- The player with the initiative is the first active player.
- Play proceeds clockwise.
- The action phase ends when each player has passed consecutively.

## Player Elimination
- When a player's base has no remaining HP, they are eliminated.
- All cards they own are removed from play.
- Cards owned by other players in their play area go to their owners' discard piles.
- Eliminated players' triggered abilities are ignored.
- Lasting effects created by eliminated players remain active for the round.
- If a player eliminates another player (such as by being the last player to damage the eliminated player's base), they immediately heal 5 damage from their own base.

## Initiative
- If an eliminated player controlled the initiative counter, return it to the center.

## Additional Rules
- Players may freely discuss the game, but deals are not binding.
- For card abilities, "opponent" refers to any other player, and "opponents" refers to each other player.
- Abilities affecting multiple players resolve simultaneously if possible, otherwise in an order chosen by the active player.
- Sentinel only prevents attacks on its controller's units and base, not attacks between other players.
- For Bounty abilities in multiplayer games, the opponent who defeats/captures a unit with Bounty must be chosen as the opponent who may collect that Bounty.

## Twin Suns Format
- Special multiplayer format with unique rules.
- Each deck has two leaders sharing either the Heroism or Villainy aspect.
- Only one copy of each card allowed in the deck.
- Uses additional blast and plan counters.
- Players take an Available Counter action instead of Take the Initiative.
- Game ends when one player is eliminated; player with most remaining HP wins.
