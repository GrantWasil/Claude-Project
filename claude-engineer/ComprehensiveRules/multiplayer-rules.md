## A. General Rules
- Multiplayer games can be played with constructed or limited decks.
- All standard rules apply unless otherwise specified.
- Recommended for 3-4 players, but can accommodate more with adjusted rules.

## B. Setup
- Players choose whether to mulligan in clockwise order, starting with the active player.
- Each player has a portion of the [ground and space arenas](game-zones.md#b-ground-arena) in their play area.
- Determine seating order randomly.

## C. Gameplay
- The player with the initiative is the first active player.
- Play proceeds clockwise.
- The [action phase](turn-structure.md#2-action-phase) ends when each player has passed consecutively.
- Combat between non-adjacent players is allowed but may have restrictions based on card text.

Example: In a 4-player game, Player A attacks Player C's unit across the table. This is allowed, but a card that says "Attack an adjacent player's unit" would only allow attacks on Player B or D's units.

## D. Player Elimination
- When a player's [base](game-zones.md#a-base-zone) has no remaining HP, they are eliminated.
- All cards they own are removed from play.
- Cards owned by other players in their play area go to their owners' [discard piles](game-zones.md#g-discard-pile).
- Eliminated players' [triggered abilities](abilities-and-effects.md#a5-triggered-abilities) are ignored.
- [Lasting effects](abilities-and-effects.md#b1-lasting-effects) created by eliminated players remain active for the round.
- If a player eliminates another player (such as by being the last player to damage the eliminated player's base), they immediately heal 5 damage from their own base.

Example: Player A is eliminated. They had control of Player B's unit due to a card effect. That unit returns to Player B's control and remains in play.

## E. Initiative
- If an eliminated player controlled the initiative counter, return it to the center.
- The next player clockwise from the eliminated player gains control of the initiative counter.

## F. Additional Rules
- Players may freely discuss the game, but deals are not binding.
- For card abilities, "opponent" refers to any other player, and "opponents" refers to each other player.
- Abilities affecting multiple players resolve simultaneously if possible, otherwise in an order chosen by the active player.
- [Sentinel](keywords.md#h-sentinel) only prevents attacks on its controller's units and base, not attacks between other players.
- For [Bounty](keywords.md#b-bounty) abilities in multiplayer games, the opponent who defeats/captures a unit with Bounty must be chosen as the opponent who may collect that Bounty.
- Area-of-effect abilities (e.g., "deal 1 damage to each unit") affect all applicable targets, regardless of controller.

Example: Player A plays a card that says "Deal 2 damage to each opponent's base." This affects all other players' bases, not just the bases of adjacent players.

## G. Twin Suns Format
- Special multiplayer format with unique rules.
- Each deck has two [leaders](card-types.md#3-leader) sharing either the Heroism or Villainy aspect.
- Only one copy of each card allowed in the deck.
- Uses additional blast and plan counters:
  - Blast counter: When taken, deal 1 damage to each opponent's base.
  - Plan counter: When taken, draw 1 card, then place 1 card from hand on the bottom of your deck.
- Players take an Available Counter action instead of [Take the Initiative](player-actions.md#d-take-the-initiative).
- Game ends when one player is eliminated; player with most remaining HP wins.
- Detailed Twin Suns rules:
  1. Setup: Place blast and plan counters in the center along with the initiative counter.
  2. During the action phase, players may take the "Take an Available Counter" action.
  3. A player can only take one counter per round.
  4. After taking a counter, a player passes for the rest of the action phase.
  5. The action phase ends when all counters are taken or all players have passed.

Example: In a 3-player Twin Suns game, there are 2 blast counters and 1 plan counter available each round. Player A takes a blast counter, dealing 1 damage to both opponents' bases. Player B takes the plan counter, drawing a card and tucking another. Player C takes the last blast counter, dealing 1 more damage to both opponents' bases.

Strategic Considerations for Twin Suns:
- Balance between taking blast counters for immediate damage and plan counters for card advantage.
- Consider your deck's strategy when choosing between Heroism and Villainy leaders.
- Pay attention to the order of counter selection, as later picks may be more predictable.
- Use the unique deckbuilding restrictions to create synergies between your two leaders.

## H. Multiplayer Strategies

1. Threat Assessment: Constantly evaluate which player poses the biggest threat and adjust your strategy accordingly.

2. Politics: Use diplomacy to form temporary alliances or convince others to target a specific player.

3. Resource Management: Balance your resources between offense and defense, as you'll need to both attack and defend against multiple opponents.

4. Timing: Save powerful effects for when they can impact multiple opponents or swing the game in your favor.

5. Bluffing: Use the multiplayer nature of the game to your advantage by bluffing about your hand or intentions.

6. Board Presence: Maintain a strong board presence to deter attacks and have options for both offense and defense.

7. Adaptability: Be prepared to change your strategy as the game progresses and player dynamics shift.

## I. Multiplayer Interaction Examples

1. Chained Effects:
   Player A plays a card that forces Player B to discard a card. Player B discards a card with a "When Discarded" effect that damages Player C's unit. Player C's unit has a "When Damaged" effect that allows them to draw a card.

2. Diplomatic Plays:
   Player A, with a powerful unit on the board, offers to attack Player C's threatening unit if Player B agrees not to attack Player A on their next turn.

3. Multi-Target Abilities:
   Player A uses an ability that says "Deal 1 damage to up to 3 target units." They choose one unit controlled by Player B, one by Player C, and one by Player D, affecting all opponents at once.

4. Initiative Manipulation:
   In a 4-player game, Player A passes early in the round, hoping that Players B and C will exhaust their resources dealing with each other, allowing Player A to claim initiative for the next round.

5. Sentinel Interactions:
   Player A has a Sentinel unit. Player B attacks Player C, who also has a Sentinel unit. Player A's Sentinel does not prevent this attack, as it only protects Player A's units and base.

These examples showcase the complex interactions and strategic depth that multiplayer games can offer in Star Wars Unlimited.
