## A. Ambush
- When played, the unit may ready and attack an enemy unit.
- Resolves during the same window as "When Played" [triggered abilities](abilities-and-effects.md#a5-triggered-abilities).
- Example: A unit with Ambush enters play exhausted but can immediately ready and attack, potentially surprising the opponent.
- Additional interaction: If a unit with Ambush also has a "When Played" ability, the player chooses the order in which to resolve Ambush and the "When Played" ability.
- Strategic tip: Use Ambush units to remove key enemy units or deal unexpected damage to the opponent's base.
- Counter strategy: Keep resources ready to play defensive events or abilities in response to Ambush units.

## B. Bounty
- When Defeated/When Captured: An opponent may resolve the specified ability.
- Each Bounty ability is independent; a unit can have multiple Bounties.
- Example: "Bounty - Draw a card" allows an opponent to draw a card when this unit is defeated.
- Additional interaction: If a unit with multiple Bounties is defeated, the opponent may choose to resolve any number of the Bounties in any order.
- Strategic tip: Use Bounty units to create dilemmas for your opponent, forcing them to choose between leaving a threat on the board or giving you an advantage.
- Counter strategy: Use effects that return Bounty units to hand or deck instead of defeating them to avoid triggering the Bounty.

## C. Grit
- The unit gets +1/+0 for each damage on it.
- Does not stack with multiple instances.
- Example: A 2/3 unit with Grit that has taken 2 damage would have 4 power and 1 remaining HP.
- Additional interaction: Grit works well with units that have high HP or abilities that prevent them from being defeated.
- Strategic tip: Use healing effects strategically on Grit units to maintain their increased power while keeping them alive.
- Counter strategy: Use effects that deal exactly lethal damage to Grit units to prevent them from benefiting from the power boost.

## D. Overwhelm
- While attacking, the unit deals excess damage to the defending player's [base](game-zones.md#a-base-zone).
- Excess damage is considered combat damage but not an attack on the base.
- If an attacker with Overwhelm would deal combat damage to a defender that has a Shield token, the Shield token is defeated and no damage is dealt to the enemy base.
- Example: A 5/5 unit with Overwhelm attacks a 2/3 unit. It defeats the defender and deals 3 damage to the opponent's base.
- Additional interaction: Overwhelm combines well with power-boosting effects to maximize damage to the opponent's base.
- Strategic tip: Use Overwhelm units to pressure your opponent's base while also controlling the board.
- Counter strategy: Use high-HP defenders or damage prevention effects to minimize Overwhelm damage.

## E. Raid X
- While attacking, the unit gets +X power.
- Multiple instances of Raid stack.
- Example: A unit with Raid 2 gains +2 power while attacking, potentially allowing it to defeat stronger defenders.
- Additional interaction: Raid works well with Overwhelm, as the extra power can translate to more damage to the opponent's base.
- Strategic tip: Use Raid units to trade up, attacking and defeating more expensive enemy units.
- Counter strategy: Use defensive buffs or damage prevention to negate the Raid bonus during combat.

## F. Restore X
- On Attack: Heal X damage from your base.
- Multiple instances of Restore stack.
- Example: A unit with Restore 2 heals 2 damage from its controller's base each time it attacks.
- Additional interaction: Restore can be particularly effective with units that have multiple attack opportunities, such as those with Ambush or readying effects.
- Strategic tip: Use Restore units to maintain your base's health while still applying pressure to your opponent.
- Counter strategy: Focus on defeating Restore units quickly or use effects that prevent them from attacking.

## G. Saboteur
- May ignore Sentinel when choosing what to attack.
- On Attack: Defeat all Shield tokens attached to the defender.
- Example: A unit with Saboteur can attack the opponent's base even if they control a unit with Sentinel.
- Additional interaction: Saboteur is particularly effective against strategies that rely heavily on Sentinel or Shielded units.
- Strategic tip: Use Saboteur units to bypass your opponent's defenses and target their most valuable units or base directly.
- Counter strategy: Protect key units with multiple layers of defense beyond just Sentinel or Shield tokens.

## H. Sentinel
- Enemy units in this arena can't attack your non-Sentinel units or your base.
- Overrides abilities that prevent the unit from being attacked.
- Example: While you control a unit with Sentinel, your opponent must attack it before targeting other units or your base.
- Additional interaction: Multiple Sentinel units can create a strong defensive wall, forcing your opponent to defeat them all before reaching your other units or base.
- Strategic tip: Use Sentinel units to protect valuable non-Sentinel units or to buy time while building up your resources and hand.
- Counter strategy: Use removal effects or Saboteur units to bypass Sentinel units, or build up a large attack force to overwhelm the Sentinel defense.

## I. Shielded
- When Played (non-leader unit) or When Deployed ([leader](card-types.md#3-leader) unit): Give a Shield token to this unit.
- Example: A unit with Shielded enters play with a Shield token, which can prevent the next instance of damage it would take.
- Additional interaction: Shielded works well with high-value units that your opponent wants to remove quickly.
- Strategic tip: Use Shielded units to protect key parts of your strategy or to force your opponent to commit multiple resources to remove a single unit.
- Counter strategy: Use effects that defeat Shield tokens without dealing damage, or save removal effects for after the Shield token has been used.

## J. Smuggle [Y]
- You may pay cost Y to play this card from your [resource zone](game-zones.md#d-resource-zone), replacing it with the top card of your deck.
- This ability is active while the card is a resource.
- Playing a card using Smuggle is considered a "Play a Card" [action](player-actions.md#a-play-a-card).
- The card played using Smuggle is considered both to enter play and to be played.
- Example: A card with "Smuggle [3]" in your resource zone can be played by paying 3 resources, even if it's not in your hand.
- Additional interaction: Smuggle can be used to surprise your opponent with units or events they thought were unavailable.
- Strategic tip: Use Smuggle to increase the flexibility of your resources, allowing you to adapt to different game states.
- Counter strategy: Be aware of your opponent's resources and consider the possibility of Smuggle cards when planning your turns.

## K. General Keyword Rules
- Keyword abilities resolve automatically unless they include the word "may".
- If a card gains a keyword it already has, those keywords don't "stack" unless followed by a numeral.
- Keywords followed by a numeral, cost, or em dash and ability text are considered separate abilities if gained multiple times.
- Interaction example: A unit with both Ambush and Raid 2 can ready and attack when played, gaining +2 power for that attack.

## L. Keyword Combinations and Synergies

1. Ambush + Raid: Units with both these keywords can enter play and immediately attack with increased power, potentially removing a key enemy unit unexpectedly.

2. Overwhelm + Grit: As a unit with Grit takes damage, it becomes more powerful, potentially allowing for massive Overwhelm damage to the opponent's base.

3. Sentinel + Restore: This combination allows you to protect your other units and base while also healing your base each time the Sentinel unit attacks.

4. Saboteur + Overwhelm: Saboteur allows the unit to bypass Sentinel defenders, potentially dealing significant Overwhelm damage directly to the opponent's base.

5. Shielded + Grit: The initial Shield token allows the unit to safely take damage, activating its Grit ability without risk of being defeated.

6. Smuggle + Ambush: This combination allows for surprise attacks from your resource zone, catching opponents off-guard.

7. Raid + Restore: Units with both these keywords become more effective attackers while also providing defensive value through base healing.

When deck building, consider these synergies to create powerful combinations that can give you an edge in various game situations. However, be aware that focusing too heavily on keyword synergies can make your strategy more predictable, so balance is key.
