## 1. General
1.1. A keyword or keyword ability is a card ability indicated with bold red text and that has specific associated rules.

1.2. A keyword ability resolves automatically unless its definition includes the word "may."

1.3. Card abilities may give a keyword to a unit, either as a constant ability or a lasting effect. While the ability or effect persists, the unit is considered to have that keyword in its text box, and that keyword can be lost, ignored, or affected by other abilities.

1.4. If a card is given a keyword it already has, those keywords do not "stack" (meaning, the card does not gain any additional effects) unless those keywords are followed by a numeral, a cost, or an em dash and ability text; if they are, the numbers following each keyword are added together. If they are followed by a cost or an em dash and ability text, each keyword is considered its own ability.

## 2. Ambush
2.1. "Ambush" is a keyword whose effect is the same as the triggered ability: "When Played: If there is an enemy unit that this unit can attack, this unit may ready and attack that enemy unit."

2.2. Multiple instances of Ambush do not stack. If a unit gains Ambush multiple times, it may only ready and attack a unit once.

2.3. A unit with Ambush still enters play exhausted like any other (non-leader) unit and cannot ready if there are no enemy units it can attack.

2.4. The Ambush keyword resolves during the same window as any "When Played" abilities on the unit.

2.5. An attack resulting from Ambush is resolved like any other attack, with all of the same steps.

## 3. Grit
3.1. "Grit" is a keyword whose effect is the same as the constant ability: "This unit gets +1/+0 for each damage on it."

3.2. Multiple instances of Grit do not stack. If a unit gains Grit when it already has Grit, the unit's power does not change.

3.3. When a unit with Grit deals and is dealt damage simultaneously (i.e. during combat), the unit with Grit does not get increased power from the new damage until after all damage is dealt.

## 4. Overwhelm
4.1. "Overwhelm" is a keyword whose effect is the same as the constant ability: "While attacking, this unit deals its excess damage to the defending player's base."

4.2. Multiple instances of Overwhelm do not stack.

4.3. An attacker with Overwhelm deals combat damage to the defender and the enemy base simultaneously.

4.4. When an attacker with Overwhelm deals excess damage to a base, it is considered to have dealt combat damage to the base, but it is not considered to have attacked that base.

4.5. If an attacker with Overwhelm would deal combat damage to a defender that has a Shield token, the Shield token is defeated and no damage is dealt to the enemy base.

## 5. Raid X
5.1. "Raid" is a keyword whose effect is the same as the constant ability: "While attacking, this unit gets +X power," where X is the number following "Raid."

5.2. Multiple instances of Raid stack. If a unit gains Raid when it already has Raid, the numerals following each instance of Raid are added together, and when the unit attacks, it gets bonus power equal to the total value.

5.3. An attacker gets bonus power from Raid during an attack and loses the bonus power when the attack completes, for the same duration as "While this unit is attacking" abilities.

## 6. Restore X
6.1. "Restore" is a keyword whose effect is the same as the triggered ability: "On Attack: Heal X damage from your base," where X is the number following "Restore."

6.2. Multiple instances of Restore stack. If a unit gains Restore when it already has Restore, the numerals following each instance of Restore are added together, and when the unit attacks it heals damage equal to the total value.

## 7. Saboteur
7.1. "Saboteur" is a keyword whose effect encompasses two abilities, a constant ability and a triggered ability. Saboteur's effect is the same as the abilities: "This unit may ignore Sentinel when choosing what to attack" and "On Attack: Defeat all Shield tokens attached to the defender."

7.2. To "ignore" Sentinel means to determine the defender or base being attacked as if no enemy units in the attacker's arena have Sentinel. Enemy units do not lose Sentinel while Sentinel is ignored.

## 8. Sentinel
8.1. "Sentinel" is a keyword whose effect is the same as the constant ability: "Units in this arena can't attack your non-Sentinel units or your base. Abilities this unit gains can't prevent this unit from being attacked."

8.2. When a player makes an attack, after exhausting the attacker, the player checks if there are any enemy units in the attacker's arena with Sentinel. If there are one or more, the attacking player cannot choose a non-Sentinel unit as the defender (unless the attacker has Saboteur).

8.3. If the attacker has the Saboteur keyword, its controller ignores the Sentinel keyword on enemy units in the attacker's arena, and may choose to attack any unit in the same arena or the opponent's base.

8.4. If a unit has Sentinel and an ability where it "can't be attacked," Sentinel overrides that ability, and that unit can be attacked.

## 9. Shielded
9.1. When on a non-leader unit, "Shielded" is a keyword whose effect is the same as the triggered ability: "When Played: Give a Shield token to this unit." When on a leader unit, "Shielded" is a keyword whose effect is the same as to the triggered ability: "When Deployed: Give a Shield token to this unit."

9.2. Shielded resolves in the same window as any "When Played" abilities on the unit.

## 10. Bounty
10.1. "Bounty" is a keyword followed by an em dash and ability text whose effect is the same as the triggered ability: "When Defeated/When Captured: An opponent may resolve the following ability. That opponent is considered to control this ability."

10.2. Each Bounty ability on a unit is considered an independent ability. A unit can have multiple Bounty abilities and can be given the same Bounty ability multiple times.

10.3. Bounty resolves in the same window as any "When Defeated" or "When Captured" abilities on the unit.

10.4. To "collect a Bounty" is to resolve a triggered Bounty ability.

10.5. Resolving a Bounty ability is optional. If a player chooses not to resolve a Bounty ability, they are not considered to have collected that Bounty.

10.6. Bounty abilities are always resolved by an opponent. If a player defeats their own unit that has a Bounty ability, they must choose an opponent to resolve its Bounty ability.

## 11. Smuggle [Y]
11.1. "Smuggle" is a keyword whose effect is the same as the constant ability: "You may pay cost Y to play this card from your resource zone, replacing it with the top card of your deck. This ability is active while this card is a resource," where Y is the cost in brackets following "Smuggle." Paying this cost follows all normal rules for paying costs, including accounting for any aspect penalties that modify this cost.

11.2. Each Smuggle ability on a unit is considered an independent ability. A unit can have multiple Smuggle abilities.

11.3. Playing a card using Smuggle is considered a "Play a Card" action, without the restriction that the card must be played from hand.

11.4. While in the resource zone, a resource whose facedown side has a Smuggle ability is considered to have Smuggle. Once in play, the card is still considered to have Smuggle. A Smuggle ability on a facedown card is considered hidden information to opponents.

11.5. As the card is still in the resource zone while paying costs, a card with Smuggle can be exhausted to help pay its own Smuggle cost.

11.6. A unit or upgrade played using Smuggle is considered both to enter play and to be played. Any "When Played" abilities on the card trigger. If it is a unit, the unit enters play exhausted. If it is an event, it is placed in its owner's discard pile.

11.7. As it enters play, a card played using Smuggle is replaced in the resource zone by the top card of a player's deck. The two cards are considered to enter play simultaneously. The new resource enters play exhausted.

11.8. A player may still use Smuggle to play a card even if their deck is empty. In this case, they do not replace the card in their resource zone. They are not considered to have attempted to draw a card from their empty deck, and they do not put damage on their base.
