## A. Ambush
- When played, the unit may ready and attack an enemy unit.
- Resolves during the same window as "When Played" [triggered abilities](abilities-and-effects.md#a5-triggered-abilities).

## B. Bounty
- When Defeated/When Captured: An opponent may resolve the specified ability.
- Each Bounty ability is independent; a unit can have multiple Bounties.

## C. Grit
- The unit gets +1/+0 for each damage on it.
- Does not stack with multiple instances.

## D. Overwhelm
- While attacking, the unit deals excess damage to the defending player's [base](game-zones.md#a-base-zone).
- Excess damage is considered combat damage but not an attack on the base.
- If an attacker with Overwhelm would deal combat damage to a defender that has a Shield token, the Shield token is defeated and no damage is dealt to the enemy base.

## E. Raid X
- While attacking, the unit gets +X power.
- Multiple instances of Raid stack.

## F. Restore X
- On Attack: Heal X damage from your base.
- Multiple instances of Restore stack.

## G. Saboteur
- May ignore Sentinel when choosing what to attack.
- On Attack: Defeat all Shield tokens attached to the defender.

## H. Sentinel
- Enemy units in this arena can't attack your non-Sentinel units or your base.
- Overrides abilities that prevent the unit from being attacked.

## I. Shielded
- When Played (non-leader unit) or When Deployed ([leader](card-types.md#3-leader) unit): Give a Shield token to this unit.

## J. Smuggle [Y]
- You may pay cost Y to play this card from your [resource zone](game-zones.md#d-resource-zone), replacing it with the top card of your deck.
- This ability is active while the card is a resource.
- Playing a card using Smuggle is considered a "Play a Card" [action](player-actions.md#a-play-a-card).
- The card played using Smuggle is considered both to enter play and to be played.

## K. General Keyword Rules
- Keyword abilities resolve automatically unless they include the word "may".
- If a card gains a keyword it already has, those keywords don't "stack" unless followed by a numeral.
- Keywords followed by a numeral, cost, or em dash and ability text are considered separate abilities if gained multiple times.
