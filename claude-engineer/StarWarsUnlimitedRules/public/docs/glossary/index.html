                description: "An overview of the different card types in Star Wars Unlimited",
                content: "General linkA card’s type is located in the top left corner of the card. There are 6 different types of cards: bases, events, leaders, units, upgrades, and tokens.\nA “resource” is not a type of card, but a game object that a card becomes when placed in the resource zone.\nBase link Represents a location in Star Wars. Has a name, trait(s), HP value, and aspect icon. Some bases also have an ability. Each player’s deck must have exactly 1 base, which begins the game in its owner’s base zone. Can be damaged through abilities and enemy attacks. Some abilities heal damage from a base (e.g., Restore keyword). When a base has no remaining HP, its owner immediately loses the game. Event link Has a name, cost, trait(s), and ability. May also have aspect icons. To play: pay its cost, place it in the owner’s discard pile, then resolve its ability. Moves directly from hand to discard pile when played. Can affect itself if it affects cards in the discard pile. Leader link Double-sided card with a horizontal “Leader side” and a vertical “Leader Unit side.” Each side has two aspect icons, a name, subtitle, trait(s), and abilities. Each player’s deck must have exactly 1 leader, starting in the base zone on its Leader side. Deployed using the Epic Action ability on its Leader side. When defeated as a Leader Unit, it flips to its Leader side and moves to the owner’s base zone, exhausted. Unit link Depicts a Star Wars character or vehicle. Has a name, cost, power, HP, trait(s), and arena type. May have a subtitle, aspect icons, abilities, and a unique icon (⟡). Played by paying its cost and placing it in its designated arena (ground or space). Enters play exhausted and remains until defeated. Defeated when it has no remaining HP or by an ability. Upgrade link Attaches to a unit. Has a name, cost, trait(s), power modifier, and HP modifier. May have aspect icons, abilities, and a unique icon (⟡). Played by paying its cost and attaching it to a unit in play. May have specific attachment restrictions. Can be attached to friendly or enemy units. Defeated when the attached unit leaves play or by an ability. Token link Has a second type, such as “token upgrade.” Set aside at the start of the game. Cannot be shuffled into decks or discarded.

                description: "An overview of abilities and effects in Star Wars Unlimited",
                content: "Abilities and effects are core components of Star Wars Unlimited, defining how cards interact with each other and impact the game state. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the different types of abilities and effects, their resolution, and timing considerations.\nTable of Contents link General Types of Abilities Effects Resolving Abilities and Effects Timing and Triggers General linkAn ability is specialized game text that indicates how a card affects the game. If a card has any printed abilities, they are found in the text box of that card.\nAn upgrade can give an ability to a unit if that upgrade indicates that the attached unit “gains” the ability; treat the unit as having the ability in its text box for as long as the upgrade is attached to it.\nUnless otherwise specified, a player controls the abilities on cards they play and control.\nAn effect is a non-cost part of a card ability that has the potential to change the game state. Some effects resolve separately from the ability that created them, or replace the standard resolution of the ability that created them.\nTypes of Abilities linkConstant Abilities link A constant ability is always in effect while the card it is on is in play. Constant abilities don’t have any special styling. A constant ability immediately comes into effect when the card it is on enters play and remains in effect while the card is in play. Some constant abilities continuously check the game for a specific condition to be met for their effects to apply to the game. These abilities usually include the word “while.” Constant abilities remain in effect even if the card they’re on is exhausted. Example: “While this unit is attacking, it gets +2 power.”\nTriggered Abilities link Triggered abilities have bold text indicating their triggering condition, starting with the word “When” or “On”, followed by a colon and an effect. For a triggered ability to resolve, the card with the ability must be in play when the triggering condition occurs, unless the ability specifies that it can be triggered from an out-of-play zone. A triggered ability must resolve once its triggering condition is met unless the ability uses the phrase “you may.” Example: “When this unit enters play: Draw a card.”\nAction Abilities link An action ability is an ability indicated by the bolded word “Action.” Most action abilities have a cost in brackets that must be paid in order to use the ability. Using an action ability is one type of action a player can take during their turn. An Epic Action ability is a type of action ability that can only be used once per game. Example: “Action [Exhaust]: Ready another unit you control.”\nEvent Abilities link An event ability is an ability found in the text box of an event and is resolved when the event is played. When an event is played, it is placed in its owner’s discard pile before its ability resolves. An event ability must be resolved as completely as possible. Any part of the event ability that cannot be resolved is ignored. Example: “Deal 2 damage to target unit.”\nKeyword Abilities link A keyword or keyword ability is a card ability indicated with bold red text and that has specific associated rules. For more details, see the Keywords section. A keyword ability resolves automatically unless its definition includes the word “may.” If a card is given a keyword it already has, those keywords do not “stack” unless those keywords are followed by a numeral, a cost, or an em dash and ability text. Example: “Ambush” (Allows a unit to ready and attack when played if there’s a valid target)\nEffects linkLasting Effects link A lasting effect is a part of an ability that affects the game for a specified duration of time. Most lasting effects include the phrase “for this phase” or “for this attack.” A lasting effect persists beyond the resolution of the ability that created it and for the duration specified by the ability, even if the ability that created the effect was on a card that left play. Example: “Target unit gets +3 power for this phase.”\nDelayed Effects link A delayed effect is created when a card ability indicates a future timing point or a future condition that may arise and an effect that will happen at that time. Delayed effects resolve automatically and immediately after their specified timing point or future condition occurs, before any other abilities triggered by that timing point or condition. Example: “At the end of this phase, destroy this unit.”\nReplacement Effects link A replacement effect occurs when part or all of the standard resolution of a triggering condition or ability is replaced with an alternate resolution. This alternate resolution is the “replacement effect.” Replacement effects are indicated by the words “instead” or “would.” A replacement effect must be resolved immediately upon its condition being met, unless the effect uses the phrase “you may.” Example: “If this unit would be defeated, instead return it to your hand.”\nResolving Abilities and Effects link When a player resolves an ability, they must resolve the effects of that ability in the order they are written. If an ability allows a player to choose some number of options, they may resolve those options in any order. If an ability that affects both players can be resolved simultaneously, resolve the ability simultaneously. Otherwise, the player that controls the card with the ability can choose the order in which each player is affected by the ability. Timing and Triggers link A triggered ability is considered to resolve during the same turn or game step that it was triggered. For more information on turn structure, see the Turn Structure section. Resolving a triggered ability is not the same as taking an action. A player can resolve a triggered ability outside of their turn. If an ability triggers during or as the result of a non-attack action, resolve that ability at the next available opportunity after that action is fully completed. If an ability triggers during an attack, resolve that ability at the appropriate timing point within that attack. If a player must resolve multiple triggered abilities on cards they control at the same time, that player chooses the order in which to resolve those abilities. If both players must resolve triggered abilities on cards they control at the same time, the active player chooses one player at a time to resolve abilities. When chosen, that player resolves all abilities triggered on cards they control in the order of their choice, and once they finish, the other player does the same on cards they control. After resolving a triggered ability “A”, if any new abilities were triggered while resolving it, the new abilities are considered “nested abilities” and must be resolved before any other abilities triggered at the same time as ability “A”. For more detailed information on specific abilities and their interactions, please refer to the Glossary and other sections of the comprehensive rules document.\nSee Also link Card Types Game Zones Turn Structure Player Actions Keywords "

                content: "Overview linkThis section covers the fundamental concepts and rules for Star Wars Unlimited. Understanding these core mechanics is essential for gameplay.\nGeneral Concepts link Star Wars Unlimited is typically a two-player card game, with optional multiplayer rules. Players need one deck each, an initiative counter, damage counters, and token cards. Deck size varies by format, with specific requirements for leaders, bases, and other cards. Leaders and bases are part of a deck for deckbuilding but separate during gameplay. Tokens are not part of a player’s deck and don’t count toward deck size. Players may include cards from any aspect in their deck, potentially incurring aspect penalties. Golden Rules link Card text overrides general rules when in direct conflict. Resolve as much of an ability as possible, ignoring impossible parts. Restrictive abilities take precedence over permissive ones. Players and Active Player link The active player is currently taking an action. Players alternate being active during the action phase. The player with the initiative counter is considered active during non-action phases. Card Ownership and Control link Card owners are determined by initial deck composition. Controllers play, use, and affect cards they control. Control can change through specific card abilities. Ready and Exhausted States link Ready cards are upright; exhausted cards are sideways. Most cards enter play exhausted, with some exceptions. Cards ready through abilities or during the regroup phase. Exhausting is often a cost for actions or attacks. Defeating Cards link In-play cards can be defeated when meeting certain conditions: Bases: Damage equal to or greater than HP Units: Damage equal to or greater than HP or by direct abilities Upgrades: When attached unit leaves play or by direct abilities Tokens: Set aside when defeated Resources: Moved to discard pile when defeated Aspects and Unique Cards linkAspects linkThere are six aspects in Star Wars Unlimited:\nVigilance Command Aggression Cunning Villainy Heroism\nAspect penalties apply when playing cards not matching leader/base aspects. The penalty is 2 additional resources per missing aspect icon. Unique Cards link Indicated by a ⟡ symbol before the name. Players can only control one copy of each unique card at a time. Resources and Costs link Resources are used to pay for cards and abilities. Costs are paid by exhausting ready resources. Players can add one resource per regroup phase. Some abilities allow additional resource placement. Card costs can be modified by abilities. Damage and HP link Damage is tracked with counters on cards with HP. Damage persists until healed or the card leaves play. Units are defeated when damage equals or exceeds HP. A player loses when their base’s damage equals or exceeds its HP. Power link Power determines a unit’s combat damage. Can be modified by upgrades and abilities. Cannot be reduced below 0. Game State link Encompasses all current game information. Players must change the game state on their turn (except when passing). Open and Hidden Information link Open information is available to all players (e.g., faceup cards, discard piles). Hidden information has restrictions (e.g., hand cards, deck order). Arenas link Two types: Ground and Space. Units are played into a specific arena. Some abilities can move units between arenas. Initiative link Determines the first player in various game phases. Can change through card abilities or game effects. Timing and Priority link Follows a specific order for resolving abilities and effects. Active player generally has priority to act first.

                description: "Detailed explanation of game structure and turn sequence in Star Wars Unlimited",
                content: "Turn Structure in Star Wars Unlimited linkUnderstanding the turn structure is crucial for mastering Star Wars Unlimited. This section provides a comprehensive overview of how each game round unfolds, from setup to victory. A solid grasp of turn structure will help you plan your strategies and make the most of each action.\n1. Game Overview linkA game of Star Wars Unlimited consists of multiple rounds, each divided into two main phases: the Action Phase and the Regroup Phase. Players alternate taking actions during the Action Phase and prepare for the next round during the Regroup Phase. The game continues until one player achieves victory by reducing their opponent’s base to 0 HP or through other win conditions.\n2. Starting the Game linkBefore the first round begins, players must set up the game:\nPlace bases into play Put leaders into play Determine the first player (usually by rolling a die or flipping a coin) Shuffle decks and draw opening hands of 5 cards each Choose whether to mulligan (redraw your entire hand once) Resource two cards (place two cards face-down in your resource row) For detailed setup instructions, see the Setup and Victory section.\n3. Round Structure linkEach round in Star Wars Unlimited follows this structure:\n3.1 Action Phase linkThe Action Phase is the core of the game, where players take turns performing actions. It consists of:\nStart of phase step\nResolve any “at the start of the action phase” effects This is when many ongoing effects trigger or refresh Player turns\nPlayers alternate taking one action at a time Available actions: Play a Card (deploy units, use events, attach upgrades) Attack With a Unit (engage enemy units or the opponent’s base) Use an Action Ability (activate special abilities on cards) Take the Initiative (gain control of the initiative token) Pass (decline to take an action) End of phase step\nResolve any “at the end of the action phase” effects Check for any end-of-phase triggered abilities Example: During her turn in the Action Phase, Player A decides to play a unit card from her hand. She pays the resource cost by exhausting the required number of resource cards and places the unit in the appropriate arena. The unit’s “When Played” ability triggers, if it has one. It’s now Player B’s turn to take an action.\nStrategy Tip: Carefully consider the order of your actions. Sometimes it’s better to attack first before playing new units, while other times you may want to build up your forces before engaging the enemy.\n3.2 Regroup Phase linkThe Regroup Phase prepares players for the next round. It consists of 5 steps:\nStart of regroup phase\nResolve any “at the start of the regroup phase” effects This is when many end-of-round abilities trigger Draw cards\nEach player draws 2 cards If a player cannot draw due to an empty deck, they lose the game Resource cards\nStarting with the active player, each may put 1 card into play as a resource This decision can be crucial for long-term strategy Ready cards\nEach player readies all their exhausted cards This includes units, leaders, bases, and resources End of regroup phase\nResolve any “at the end of the regroup phase” effects Prepare for the next round’s Action Phase 4.

Ending the Game linkThe game ends when one of these conditions is met:\nA player’s base reaches 0 HP A player has no cards in their deck and must draw a card A player concedes A card effect causes a player to win or lose the game In the case of simultaneous win/loss conditions (e.g., both players’ bases reach 0 HP at the same time), the game is a draw.\nFor more details on victory conditions, see the Setup and Victory section.\n6. Special Rules and Exceptions link Initiative Token: The player with the initiative token can interrupt the normal turn order to take an action at any time. This can be a powerful tool for disrupting your opponent’s plans. Nested Actions: Some card effects allow you to take additional actions outside the normal turn structure. These are resolved fully before returning to the main game flow. Simultaneous Effects: If multiple effects would trigger at the same time, the active player resolves their effects first, then the non-active player. For more information on special rules and card interactions, see the Abilities and Effects section.\n7. Frequently Asked Questions linkQ: Can I take multiple actions during my turn in the Action Phase? A: No, you can only take one action per turn. After your action, play passes to your opponent. However, some card effects may grant you additional actions.\nQ: What happens if I can’t or don’t want to take an action during the Action Phase? A: You can always choose to pass. If all players pass consecutively, the Action Phase ends.\nQ: Do I have to put a card into play as a resource during the Regroup Phase? A: No, this step is optional. You may choose not to play a resource if you don’t want to or can’t. However, building your resource base is crucial for playing more powerful cards later in the game.\nQ: Can I attack with a unit I just played this turn? A: Generally, no. Units have “summoning sickness” and cannot attack the turn they are played unless they have an ability that allows them to do so (like Rush).\nQ: What happens if I run out of cards in my hand? A: You can still take actions with cards in play, but you won’t be able to play new cards until you draw more during the Regroup Phase or through card effects.\nFor more detailed information on specific actions and abilities, please refer to the Player Actions and Abilities and Effects sections.\n"

                description: "Detailed explanation of player actions and their timing in Star Wars Unlimited",
                content: "Player Actions in Star Wars Unlimited linkUnderstanding player actions is crucial for mastering Star Wars Unlimited. This section provides detailed explanations and timing charts for the core actions: Play a Card, Attack With a Unit, and Use an Action Ability.\ninfo For each type of action, perform each step in order and as completely as possible. Resolve any triggered abilities between steps before proceeding. Play A Card linkGeneral Rules link A player follows these steps when they choose to take the Play a Card action on their turn, or when they resolve an ability that lets them play a card as a nested action. To play a card, a player must have a card in their hand or be resolving an ability that allows them to play a card from another zone. A player may play a card whose ability has no effect, as long as the act of paying the costs for and playing the card changes the game state. Some action, event, and triggered abilities allow a player to play a card. Unless otherwise specified by the ability, the card must be played from the player’s hand, and the player must pay all costs of the card when playing it this way. Aspect penalties apply when playing cards, unless otherwise specified. Steps of Playing a Card link Declare intent: Announce the card you intend to play. Check restrictions: Ensure you can legally play the card (e.g., correct arena, unique restrictions). Determine cost(s): Calculate the total cost, including any modifiers or penalties. Pay cost(s): Exhaust the required number of resources. Put card into play/discard: Place the card in the appropriate zone based on its type. After playing the card, resolve any “When Played” abilities on the card and any other abilities that triggered while playing and/or resolving the card, including Ambush and Shielded.\nExample linkAlice wants to play “Luke Skywalker” from her hand. She declares her intent, checks that she has no other unique “Luke Skywalker” in play, determines the cost (including any aspect penalties), exhausts the required resources, and places Luke in her ground arena. She then resolves Luke’s “When Played” ability.\nAttack With A Unit linkGeneral Rules link A player follows these steps when they choose to take the Attack With a Unit action on their turn, or when they resolve an ability that lets them attack with a unit as a nested action. Only one unit may attack at a time, and only ready units may perform an attack, unless otherwise specified. “Combat damage” is damage dealt during the “Deal combat damage” step of an attack. Damage dealt outside of this step during an attack is not considered to be combat damage. The attacking player chooses a target for the attack. This can be an opponent’s unit in the same arena or the opponent’s base if there are no units in that arena. Steps of Attacking With a Unit link Declare the attack: Choose an attacking unit and a target. Deal combat damage: Both the attacker and defender (if a unit) deal their power in damage simultaneously. Complete the attack: Resolve any effects that trigger “after an attack” or “when a unit is defeated”. warning After each step, resolve any abilities triggered during that step before proceeding to the next step in the attack. Example linkBob attacks Alice’s base with his X-wing (power 3). He declares the attack, then deals 3 damage to Alice’s base. After the attack, Bob’s X-wing exhausts.\nUse an Action Ability linkGeneral Rules link A player follows these steps when they choose to take the Use an Action Ability action on their turn, or when they resolve an ability that lets them use an action ability as a nested action. Action abilities are abilities that begin with the bold word “Action” or “Epic Action” followed by a cost in brackets, a colon, and an ability following the colon. For more details on abilities, see the Abilities and Effects section. To use an action ability, a player must be able to pay the ability’s cost if it has one and change the game state through paying that ability’s cost and/or resolving that ability’s effect. A player can only use action abilities on cards they control, unless otherwise specified. Steps of Using an Action Ability link Declare intent: Announce which action ability you intend to use. Check restrictions: Ensure you can legally use the ability. Determine cost(s): Identify any costs associated with the ability. Pay cost(s): Pay any required costs (e.g., exhausting the card, discarding cards). Resolve the ability: Carry out the effect of the ability. After using the action ability, resolve any abilities that triggered while using the action ability.\nExample linkCharlie uses the action ability on his “Millennium Falcon” card: “Action [exhaust]: Ready another unit you control.” He declares his intent, checks that the Millennium Falcon is ready, exhausts it as the cost, then chooses another of his exhausted units to ready.\nAction Restrictions and Special Cases link Players cannot take actions between the time an ability is activated and the time it resolves, except when responding to a nested action. Some abilities allow players to take actions at unusual times, such as during an opponent’s turn. These exceptions are always explicitly stated on the card. If an ability allows a player to “take an additional action,” they may choose any of the standard actions (Play a Card, Attack With a Unit, Use an Action Ability) or pass. For more detailed information on each action and their specific rules, please refer to the Glossary and other sections of the comprehensive rules document.\n"

Multiplayer games can use decks created with either constructed or limited rules. Unless specified otherwise, all rules in the Comprehensive Rules apply to multiplayer formats. Gameplay Overview linkSetup linkSetting up a multiplayer game follows the same process as a two-player game, with one key difference:\nPlayers choose whether to take a mulligan in clockwise order, starting with the active player. For more details on game setup, see the Setup and Victory section.\nArenas linkIn multiplayer games:\nEach player has their own portion of the ground and space arenas in their play area. A player’s arena portions are on either side of their base zone. All players’ arena portions are considered part of the larger arena. Turn Structure link The player with initiative is the first active player. Play proceeds clockwise, with each player becoming the active player and taking an action. This continues until all players pass consecutively, ending the action phase. For more information on turn structure, see the Turn Structure section.\nPlayer Elimination linkA player is eliminated when their base has no remaining HP. When this happens:\nThe eliminated player can no longer take actions. All cards they own are removed from play. Cards owned by other players in their play area go to their owners’ discard piles. Their triggered abilities waiting to resolve are ignored. Lasting effects or delayed effects they created remain active. If they controlled the initiative counter, it returns to the center of the play area. notifications Eliminated players cannot be brought back into the game. Their base cannot be healed, and they cannot be affected by abilities. Additional Rules link Players may discuss the game freely, but deals between players are not binding. For card abilities, a player’s “opponent” is any other player in the game. Abilities affecting multiple players resolve simultaneously when possible. Otherwise, the ability’s controller chooses the order. Sentinel only protects its controller’s units and base, not those of other players.
