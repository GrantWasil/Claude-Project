                title: "Card Types",
                description: "An overview of the different card types in Star Wars Unlimited",
                content: "Overview linkStar Wars Unlimited features several distinct card types, each with its own role in the game. This section provides a comprehensive overview of these card types and their characteristics.\nGeneral linkA card’s type is located in the top left corner of the card. There are 6 different types of cards: bases, events, leaders, units, upgrades, and tokens.\nA “resource” is not a type of card, but a game object that a card becomes when placed in the resource zone. Resources cannot be played as cards or have their printed abilities used.\nBase link Represents a location in Star Wars. Has a name, trait(s), HP value, and aspect icon. Some bases also have an ability. Each player’s deck must have exactly 1 base, which begins the game in its owner’s base zone. Can be damaged through abilities and enemy attacks. Some abilities heal damage from a base (e.g., Restore keyword). When a base has no remaining HP, its owner immediately loses the game. Event link Has a name, cost, trait(s), and ability. May also have aspect icons. To play: pay its cost, place it in the owner’s discard pile, then resolve its ability. Moves directly from hand to discard pile when played. Can affect itself if it affects cards in the discard pile. Leader link Double-sided card with a horizontal “Leader side” and a vertical “Leader Unit side.” Each side has two aspect icons, a name, subtitle, trait(s), and abilities. Each player’s deck must have exactly 1 leader, starting in the base zone on its Leader side. Deployed using the Epic Action ability on its Leader side. When deployed, the Leader Unit side enters play in the ground arena, ready. When defeated as a Leader Unit, it flips to its Leader side and moves to the owner’s base zone, exhausted. Unit link Depicts a Star Wars character or vehicle. Has a name, cost, power, HP, trait(s), and arena type. May have a subtitle, aspect icons, abilities, and a unique icon (⟡). Played by paying its cost and placing it in its designated arena (ground or space). Enters play exhausted and remains until defeated. Can attack and be attacked. Defeated when it has no remaining HP or by an ability. Upgrade link Attaches to a unit. Has a name, cost, trait(s), power modifier, and HP modifier. May have aspect icons, abilities, and a unique icon (⟡). Played by paying its cost and attaching it to a unit in play. Enters play ready (not exhausted). May have specific attachment restrictions. Can be attached to friendly or enemy units. Defeated when the attached unit leaves play or by an ability. Token link A token is a type of card that also has a second type, such as a “token upgrade.” Tokens are set aside at the start of the game. They cannot be shuffled into decks, played from hand, resourced, or discarded. Tokens are not considered “played” when they enter play. If a token would move to an out-of-play zone for any reason, set it aside instead. It is still considered to have left play. No limit on tokens available to a player. Examples: Experience token: Gives +1 power and +1 HP to the attached unit. Shield token: Prevents the next instance of damage to the attached unit. Card Anatomy linkNote that not all cards have all of these elements. The following list covers the possible components across all card types:\nName: Top of the card (also bottom for upgrades) Subtitle: Under the name (if present) Card Type: Top left of the card Arena Type: Top right (for units) Cost: Top left corner (non-base cards) Aspects: Aspect icons on one side of the card Power: Left side of unit cards Power Modifier: Left side of upgrade cards HP: Right side of unit cards, top left of base cards HP Modifier: Right side of upgrade cards Traits: Under the name (events), under the art (units), or bottom (upgrades) Text Box: Contains card abilities Credit Line: Bottom of the card, with credit and set information Interactions Between Card Types link Units can be upgraded with upgrade cards. Events can affect multiple card types. Leaders can interact with other card types through their abilities. Bases can be affected by various card types and abilities. Deckbuilding Considerations link Each deck must contain exactly 1 base and 1 leader. Minimum deck size is typically 50 cards (excluding base and leader), but may vary by format. No more than 3 copies of a card with the same name in a deck, unless otherwise specified by a format. Unique cards (⟡) are limited to 1 copy per deck. For more detailed information on each card type and their interactions, please refer to the Glossary and other sections of the comprehensive rules.\nSee Also link Game Zones Abilities and Effects Keywords Deckbuilding Rules "

                title: "Abilities and Effects",
                description: "An overview of abilities and effects in Star Wars Unlimited",
                content: "Abilities and effects are core components of Star Wars Unlimited, defining how cards interact with each other and impact the game state. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the different types of abilities and effects, their resolution, and timing considerations.\nTable of Contents link General Types of Abilities Effects Resolving Abilities and Effects Timing and Triggers General linkAn ability is specialized game text that indicates how a card affects the game. If a card has multiple different abilities, each ability begins on a new line.\nWhen a player resolves an ability, they resolve as much of the ability as possible, and ignore any part of the ability that cannot be resolved.\nAn effect is a non-cost part of a card ability that has the potential to change the game state. Some effects resolve separately from the ability that created them, or replace the standard resolution of the ability that created them.\nTypes of Abilities linkConstant Abilities link A constant ability is always in effect while the card it is on is in play. Constant abilities don’t have any special styling. A constant ability immediately comes into effect when the card it is on enters play and remains in effect while the card is in play. Some constant abilities continuously check the game for a specific condition to be met for their effects to apply to the game. These abilities usually include the word “while.” Constant abilities remain in effect even if the card they’re on is exhausted. Example: “While this unit is undamaged, it gains Sentinel.”\nTriggered Abilities link Triggered abilities have bold text indicating their triggering condition, followed by a colon and an effect. Common triggering conditions include “When Played”, “When Defeated”, and “On Attack”. A triggered ability must resolve once its triggering condition is met unless the ability uses the phrase “you may.” Example: “When Played: Give an enemy unit -3/-3 for this phase.”\nAction Abilities link An action ability is an ability indicated by the bolded word “Action.” Most action abilities have a cost in brackets that must be paid in order to use the ability. Using an action ability is one type of action a player can take during their turn. An Epic Action ability is a type of action ability that can only be used once per game. Example: “Action [Exhaust]: Ready another unit you control.”\nEvent Abilities link An event ability is an ability found in the text box of an event and is resolved when the event is played. When an event is played, it is placed in its owner’s discard pile before its ability resolves. Events do not enter play; they move directly from the player’s hand to their discard pile. Example: “Deal 2 damage to target unit.”\nKeyword Abilities link A keyword or keyword ability is a card ability indicated with bold text and that has specific associated rules. A keyword ability resolves automatically unless its definition includes the word “may.” If a card is given a keyword it already has, those keywords do not “stack” unless those keywords are followed by a numeral, a cost, or an em dash and ability text. Example: “Ambush” (Allows a unit to ready and attack when played if there’s a valid target)\nEffects linkLasting Effects link A lasting effect is a part of an ability that affects the game for a specified duration of time. Most lasting effects include the phrase “for this phase” or “for this attack.” A lasting effect persists beyond the resolution of the ability that created it and for the duration specified by the ability, even if the ability that created the effect was on a card that left play. Multiple lasting effects can apply to the same unit at the same time. If a new lasting effect conflicts with an existing lasting effect, the new effect takes precedence. Example: “It gets +3/+0 for this attack.”\nDelayed Effects link A delayed effect is created when a card ability indicates a future timing point or a future condition that may arise and an effect that will happen at that time. Delayed effects resolve automatically and immediately after their specified timing point or future condition occurs, before any other abilities triggered by that timing point or condition. Once created, a delayed effect will resolve at the specified timing point or condition, even if the ability that created it was on a card that left play. Example: “At the start of the regroup phase, draw 1 card.”\nReplacement Effects link A replacement effect occurs when part or all of the standard resolution of a triggering condition or ability is replaced with an alternate resolution. Replacement effects are indicated by the words “instead” or “would.” A replacement effect must be resolved immediately upon its condition being met, unless the effect uses the phrase “you may.” When a replacement effect resolves, the standard resolution of the ability does not resolve and is ignored. Example: “If damage would be dealt to attached unit, prevent that damage. If you do, defeat a Shield token on it.”\nResolving Abilities and Effects link When a player resolves an ability, they must resolve the effects of that ability in the order they are written. If an ability allows a player to choose some number of options, they may resolve those options in any order. If multiple delayed effects must be resolved at the same time, the player that controls the cards that created those delayed effects chooses the order in which those effects resolve. If multiple replacement effects are triggered by the same condition, the player that controls the cards with the replacement effects chooses which effect(s) to resolve. Timing and Triggers link If an ability instructs a player to take multiple actions, that player performs each action sequentially. Any abilities triggered during or as a result of each action are considered nested abilities, and must be resolved before proceeding to the next action. If both players have one or more delayed effects that must be resolved at the same time, the active player chooses one player at a time to resolve effects. When chosen, that player resolves all delayed effects created by cards they control in the order of their choice, and once they finish, the other player does the same for their effects. If both players have one or more replacement effects triggered by the same condition, the controller of the affected object or the affected player chooses to resolve effects in any order until the condition no longer applies.

This section covers the rules for two-player constructed formats, including game setup and how to win the game.\nGeneral Rules link Star Wars Unlimited offers several game formats, defined by player count and deckbuilding method: Two-player constructed (Premier format) Multiplayer constructed (see Multiplayer Rules) Limited formats (e.g., draft, sealed) A “constructed” format allows players to build decks ahead of time from their card collection. Unless otherwise specified, all rules in the Comprehensive Rules apply to all formats. Deck Construction linkPremier Format linkThe premier format is the standard two-player constructed format for Star Wars Unlimited. Two-player starter decks follow these rules:\nDeck size: Minimum of 52 cards (there is no maximum deck size) Card limits: Exactly 1 leader Exactly 1 base A minimum of 50 other cards (consisting of units, events, and upgrades) Maximum of 3 copies of any individual unit, event, or upgrade warning Ensure your deck follows the [Aspect](game-concepts.md#aspects) rules when including cards from multiple factions. For more detailed deckbuilding rules, see the Deck Construction section.\nGame Setup linkThe basic steps for setting up a two-player game of Star Wars Unlimited are:\nShuffle your deck and place it face-down in your play area. Place your leader and base cards face-up in their designated zones. Draw your starting hand of 5 cards. Decide who goes first (usually by rolling a die or flipping a coin). The player going second draws an additional card. Each player may take a mulligan if desired: shuffle their hand back into their deck and draw a new hand with one fewer card. For a detailed, step-by-step guide to game setup, please refer to the Turn Structure section.\nVictory Conditions linkThe primary way to win a game of Star Wars Unlimited is to reduce your opponent’s base to 0 HP. However, there are additional victory conditions:\nIf a player has no cards in their deck and cannot draw when required to do so, they lose the game. If a player controls no cards in play (including their base) at the end of any phase, they lose the game. Some card effects may create alternative win conditions. If both players would win or lose simultaneously, the game is a draw.\nFor more details on winning the game and resolving simultaneous win/loss conditions, see the Player Actions section.\nAdditional Rules linkFor more information on game zones, card types, and other aspects of gameplay, please consult the following sections:\nGame Zones Card Types Game Concepts Frequently Asked Questions link Q: Can I have more than 52 cards in my deck? A: Yes, 52 is the minimum deck size. You can include more cards if you wish.\nQ: What happens if both players’ bases reach 0 HP simultaneously? A: If this occurs, the game is a draw. See Winning and Losing for more details.\nQ: Can I look at my opponent’s base card during setup? A: Yes, base cards are public information and are placed face-up during setup.\nFor more FAQs, please check the Glossary and other sections of the comprehensive rules document.\n"

                content: "Overview linkThis section covers the fundamental concepts and rules for Star Wars Unlimited. Understanding these core mechanics is essential for gameplay.\nGeneral Concepts link Star Wars Unlimited is typically a two-player card game, with optional multiplayer rules. Players need one deck each, an initiative counter, damage counters, and token cards. Deck size varies by format, with specific requirements for leaders, bases, and other cards. Leaders and bases are part of a deck for deckbuilding but separate during gameplay. Tokens are not part of a player’s deck and don’t count toward deck size. Players may include cards from any aspect in their deck, potentially incurring aspect penalties. Golden Rules link Card text overrides general rules when in direct conflict. Resolve as much of an ability as possible, ignoring impossible parts. Restrictive abilities take precedence over permissive ones. Players and Active Player link The active player is currently taking an action. Players alternate being active during the action phase. The player with the initiative counter is considered active during non-action phases. Card Ownership and Control link Card owners are determined by initial deck composition. Controllers play, use, and affect cards they control. Control can change through specific card abilities. Ready and Exhausted States link Ready cards are upright; exhausted cards are sideways. Most cards enter play exhausted, with some exceptions. Cards ready through abilities or during the regroup phase. Exhausting is often a cost for actions or attacks. Defeating Cards link In-play cards can be defeated when meeting certain conditions: Bases: Damage equal to or greater than HP Units: Damage equal to or greater than HP or by direct abilities Upgrades: When attached unit leaves play or by direct abilities Tokens: Set aside when defeated Resources: Moved to discard pile when defeated Aspects and Unique Cards linkAspects linkThere are six aspects in Star Wars Unlimited:\nVigilance Command Aggression Cunning Villainy Heroism\nAspect penalties apply when playing cards not matching leader/base aspects. The penalty is 2 additional resources per missing aspect icon. Unique Cards link Indicated by a ⟡ symbol before the name. Players can only control one copy of each unique card at a time. Resources and Costs link Resources are used to pay for cards and abilities. Costs are paid by exhausting ready resources. Players can add one resource per regroup phase. Some abilities allow additional resource placement. Card costs can be modified by abilities. Damage and HP link Damage is tracked with counters on cards with HP. Damage persists until healed or the card leaves play. Units are defeated when damage equals or exceeds HP. A player loses when their base’s damage equals or exceeds its HP. Power link Power determines a unit’s combat damage. Can be modified by upgrades and abilities. Cannot be reduced below 0. Game State link Encompasses all current game information. Players must change the game state on their turn (except when passing). Open and Hidden Information link Open information is available to all players (e.g., faceup cards, discard piles). Hidden information has restrictions (e.g., hand cards, deck order). Arenas link Two types: Ground and Space. Units are played into a specific arena. Some abilities can move units between arenas. Initiative link Determines the first player in various game phases. Can change through card abilities or game effects. Timing and Priority link Follows a specific order for resolving abilities and effects. Active player generally has priority to act first. Aspect Penalty linkThe aspect penalty is a special modifier to a card’s cost. When a player attempts to play a card with aspect icons beyond those provided by that player’s leader and/or base, the player incurs the aspect penalty, and must pay 2 additional resources for each icon beyond those provided.\nInitiative Counter linkThe initiative counter is used to keep track of which player has the initiative in the game. The player who starts a round with the initiative counter is the first active player for that round and takes the first action in that round.\nGlossary linkFor a quick reference of common game terms, see the Glossary.\nFor more details on specific topics, refer to:\nCard Types Game Zones Abilities and Effects Turn Structure Player Actions "

                content: "Turn Structure in Star Wars Unlimited linkUnderstanding the turn structure is crucial for mastering Star Wars Unlimited. This section provides a comprehensive overview of how each game round unfolds, from setup to victory. A solid grasp of turn structure will help you plan your strategies and make the most of each action.\n1. Game Overview linkA game of Star Wars Unlimited consists of multiple rounds, each divided into two main phases: the Action Phase and the Regroup Phase. Players alternate taking actions during the Action Phase and prepare for the next round during the Regroup Phase. The game continues until one player achieves victory by reducing their opponent’s base to 0 HP or through other win conditions.\n2. Starting the Game linkBefore the first round begins, players must set up the game:\nPlace bases into play Put leaders into play Determine the first player (usually by rolling a die or flipping a coin) Shuffle decks and draw opening hands of 6 cards each Choose whether to mulligan (redraw your entire hand once) Resource two cards (place two cards face-down in your resource row) For detailed setup instructions, see the Setup and Victory section.\n3. Round Structure linkEach round in Star Wars Unlimited follows this structure:\n3.1 Action Phase linkThe Action Phase is the core of the game, where players take turns performing actions. It consists of:\nStart of phase step\nResolve any “at the start of the action phase” effects This is when many ongoing effects trigger or refresh Player turns\nPlayers alternate taking one action at a time Available actions: Play a Card (deploy units, use events, attach upgrades) Attack With a Unit (engage enemy units or the opponent’s base) Use an Action Ability (activate special abilities on cards) Take the Initiative (gain control of the initiative token) Pass (decline to take an action) End of phase step\nResolve any “at the end of the action phase” effects Check for any end-of-phase triggered abilities Example: During her turn in the Action Phase, Player A decides to play a unit card from her hand. She pays the resource cost by exhausting the required number of resource cards and places the unit in the appropriate arena. The unit’s “When Played” ability triggers, if it has one. It’s now Player B’s turn to take an action.\nStrategy Tip: Carefully consider the order of your actions. Sometimes it’s better to attack first before playing new units, while other times you may want to build up your forces before engaging the enemy.\n3.2 Regroup Phase linkThe Regroup Phase prepares players for the next round. It consists of 5 steps:\nStart of regroup phase\nResolve any “at the start of the regroup phase” effects This is when many end-of-round abilities trigger Draw cards\nEach player draws 2 cards If a player cannot draw due to an empty deck, they lose the game Resource cards\nStarting with the active player, each may put 1 card into play as a resource This decision can be crucial for long-term strategy Ready cards\nEach player readies all their exhausted cards This includes units, leaders, bases, and resources End of regroup phase\nResolve any “at the end of the regroup phase” effects Prepare for the next round’s Action Phase 4.

Ending the Game linkThe game ends when one of these conditions is met:\nA player’s base reaches 0 HP A player has no cards in their deck and must draw a card A player concedes A card effect causes a player to win or lose the game In the case of simultaneous win/loss conditions (e.g., both players’ bases reach 0 HP at the same time), the game is a draw.\nFor more details on victory conditions, see the Setup and Victory section.\n6. Special Rules and Exceptions link Initiative Token: The player with the initiative token is the first active player in a round and takes the first action. The initiative token can be important for strategic planning. Nested Actions: Some card effects allow you to take additional actions outside the normal turn structure. These are resolved fully before returning to the main game flow. Simultaneous Effects: If multiple effects would trigger at the same time, the active player resolves their effects first, then the non-active player. For more information on special rules and card interactions, see the Abilities and Effects section.\n7. Frequently Asked Questions linkQ: Can I take multiple actions during my turn in the Action Phase? A: No, you can only take one action per turn. After your action, play passes to your opponent. However, some card effects may grant you additional actions.\nQ: What happens if I can’t or don’t want to take an action during the Action Phase? A: You can always choose to pass. If all players pass consecutively, the Action Phase ends.\nQ: Do I have to put a card into play as a resource during the Regroup Phase? A: No, this step is optional. You may choose not to play a resource if you don’t want to or can’t. However, building your resource base is crucial for playing more powerful cards later in the game.\nQ: Can I attack with a unit I just played this turn? A: Generally, no. Units have “summoning sickness” and cannot attack the turn they are played unless they have an ability that allows them to do so (like Rush).\nQ: What happens if I run out of cards in my hand? A: You can still take actions with cards in play, but you won’t be able to play new cards until you draw more during the Regroup Phase or through card effects.\nFor more detailed information on specific actions and abilities, please refer to the Player Actions and Abilities and Effects sections.\n"

                content: "Player Actions in Star Wars Unlimited linkUnderstanding player actions is crucial for mastering Star Wars Unlimited. This section provides detailed explanations and timing charts for the core actions: Play a Card, Attack With a Unit, and Use an Action Ability.\ninfo For each type of action, perform each step in order and as completely as possible. Resolve any triggered abilities between steps before proceeding. Play A Card linkGeneral Rules link A player follows these steps when they choose to take the Play a Card action on their turn, or when they resolve an ability that lets them play a card as a nested action. To play a card, a player must have a card in their hand or be resolving an ability that allows them to play a card from another zone. A player may play a card whose ability has no effect, as long as the act of paying the costs for and playing the card changes the game state. Some action, event, and triggered abilities allow a player to play a card. Unless otherwise specified by the ability, the card must be played from the player’s hand, and the player must pay all costs of the card when playing it this way. Aspect penalties apply when playing cards, unless otherwise specified. When playing an upgrade, it must be attached to a valid unit in play, unless otherwise specified. Steps of Playing a Card link Declare intent: Announce the card you intend to play. Check restrictions: Ensure you can legally play the card (e.g., correct arena, unique restrictions). Determine cost(s): Calculate the total cost, including any modifiers or penalties. Pay cost(s): Exhaust the required number of resources. Put card into play/discard: Place the card in the appropriate zone based on its type. After playing the card, resolve any “When Played” abilities on the card and any other abilities that triggered while playing and/or resolving the card, including Ambush and Shielded.\nExample linkAlice wants to play “Luke Skywalker” from her hand. She declares her intent, checks that she has no other unique “Luke Skywalker” in play, determines the cost (including any aspect penalties), exhausts the required resources, and places Luke in her ground arena. She then resolves Luke’s “When Played” ability.\nAttack With A Unit linkGeneral Rules link A player follows these steps when they choose to take the Attack With a Unit action on their turn, or when they resolve an ability that lets them attack with a unit as a nested action. Only one unit may attack at a time, and only ready units may perform an attack, unless otherwise specified. “Combat damage” is damage dealt during the “Deal combat damage” step of an attack. Damage dealt outside of this step during an attack is not considered to be combat damage. The attacking player chooses a target for the attack. This can be an opponent’s unit in the same arena or the opponent’s base if there are no units in that arena. Steps of Attacking With a Unit link Declare the attack: Choose an attacking unit and a target. Deal combat damage: Both the attacker and defender (if a unit) deal their power in damage simultaneously. Complete the attack: Resolve any effects that trigger “after an attack” or “when a unit is defeated”. warning After each step, resolve any abilities triggered during that step before proceeding to the next step in the attack. After the attack is completed, the attacking unit becomes exhausted (unless it has an ability that prevents this).\nExample linkBob attacks Alice’s base with his X-wing (power 3). He declares the attack, then deals 3 damage to Alice’s base. After the attack, Bob’s X-wing exhausts.\nUse an Action Ability linkGeneral Rules link A player follows these steps when they choose to take the Use an Action Ability action on their turn, or when they resolve an ability that lets them use an action ability as a nested action. Action abilities are abilities that begin with the bold word “Action” or “Epic Action” followed by a cost in brackets, a colon, and an ability following the colon. For more details on abilities, see the Abilities and Effects section. To use an action ability, a player must be able to pay the ability’s cost if it has one and change the game state through paying that ability’s cost and/or resolving that ability’s effect. A player can only use action abilities on cards they control, unless otherwise specified. Steps of Using an Action Ability link Declare intent: Announce which action ability you intend to use. Check restrictions: Ensure you can legally use the ability. Determine cost(s): Identify any costs associated with the ability. Pay cost(s): Pay any required costs (e.g., exhausting the card, discarding cards). Resolve the ability: Carry out the effect of the ability. Action abilities are resolved immediately after their cost is paid, before any other actions can be taken or abilities can be activated.\nAfter using the action ability, resolve any abilities that triggered while using the action ability.\nExample linkCharlie uses the action ability on his “Millennium Falcon” card: “Action [exhaust]: Ready another unit you control.” He declares his intent, checks that the Millennium Falcon is ready, exhausts it as the cost, then chooses another of his exhausted units to ready.\nAction Restrictions and Special Cases link Players cannot take actions between the time an ability is activated and the time it resolves, except when responding to a nested action. Some abilities allow players to take actions at unusual times, such as during an opponent’s turn. These exceptions are always explicitly stated on the card. If an ability allows a player to “take an additional action,” they may choose any of the standard actions (Play a Card, Attack With a Unit, Use an Action Ability) or pass. A player may choose to pass instead of taking an action. If both players pass consecutively, the action phase ends. For more detailed information on each action and their specific rules, please refer to the Glossary and other sections of the comprehensive rules document.\n"

                content: "Multiplayer Rules linkStar Wars Unlimited is not just limited to one-on-one battles. This section covers the rules for playing with three or more players, offering exciting new dynamics and strategies to explore.\nGeneral Rules link Star Wars Unlimited can be played with three or more players using multiplayer formats. Multiplayer games can use decks created with either constructed or limited rules. Unless specified otherwise, all rules in the Comprehensive Rules apply to multiplayer formats. The recommended player count for multiplayer games is 3-6 players. Each player starts with 30 base HP, regardless of the number of players. The Twin Suns format is a specific multiplayer variant with additional rules. See the Twin Suns section for details. Player Interaction link Players may discuss the game freely, but deals between players are not binding. Table talk is allowed and encouraged, but players cannot show their hands to each other. Players may not share resources or cards unless an ability specifically allows it. Gameplay Overview linkSetup linkSetting up a multiplayer game follows the same process as a two-player game, with these key differences:\nDetermine seating order randomly. Players choose whether to take a mulligan in clockwise order, starting with the active player. The initiative counter starts in the center of the play area. For more details on game setup, see the Setup and Victory section.\nArenas linkIn multiplayer games:\nEach player has their own portion of the ground and space arenas in their play area. A player’s arena portions are on either side of their base zone. All players’ arena portions are considered part of the larger arena. Units can attack any other player’s units or base, regardless of their position in the arena. Turn Structure link The player with initiative is the first active player. Play proceeds clockwise, with each player becoming the active player and taking an action. This continues until all players pass consecutively, ending the action phase. After the action phase, proceed to the end phase as normal. In the Twin Suns format, a plan counter is used to determine when a player’s participation in a round ends. See the Twin Suns section for details. For more information on turn structure, see the Turn Structure section.\nPlayer Elimination linkA player is eliminated when their base has no remaining HP. When this happens:\nThe eliminated player can no longer take actions or make decisions. All cards they own are removed from play. Cards owned by other players in their play area go to their owners’ discard piles. Their triggered abilities waiting to resolve are ignored. Lasting effects or delayed effects they created remain active for their specified duration. If they controlled the initiative counter, it returns to the center of the play area. The game continues with the remaining players. If multiple players would be eliminated simultaneously, they are eliminated in turn order, starting with the active player.\nnotifications Eliminated players cannot be brought back into the game. Their base cannot be healed, and they cannot be affected by abilities. Multiplayer-Specific Keywords linkWhile most keywords function the same in multiplayer games, some have specific implications:\nSentinel: Only protects its controller’s units and base, not those of other players. Overwhelm: Excess damage is still dealt only to the defending player’s base. Restore: The controller chooses which of their bases to heal. Frequently Asked Questions link Q: Can I attack multiple players in one turn? A: Yes, you can attack different players with different units, as long as each unit only attacks once per turn.\nQ: How does Bounty work in multiplayer? A: The player who defeats or captures the unit with Bounty resolves the Bounty effect, regardless of who owns the unit.\nQ: Can I use abilities that target “an opponent” on any player? A: Yes, in multiplayer games, “an opponent” refers to any other player in the game.\nFor more detailed information on multiplayer rules and interactions, please refer to the Glossary and other sections of the comprehensive rules.\n"

Each player starts with 40 base HP instead of the standard 30. Turn Structure linkThe Twin Suns format modifies the standard turn structure:\nThe active player takes actions as normal. After each action, the active player may choose to advance the plan counter. When the plan counter reaches a specific threshold (based on player count), the active player’s turn ends. Play passes to the next player clockwise. For more details on the standard turn structure, see the Turn Structure section.\nPlan Counter linkThe plan counter is a unique element of the Twin Suns format:\nIt starts at 0 at the beginning of each player’s turn. The active player may advance it by 1 after each action they take. When it reaches the threshold, the active player’s turn ends immediately. The threshold is determined by the number of players: 3-4 players: 5 5-6 players: 4 Player Elimination linkPlayer elimination follows the standard rules as described in the Multiplayer Rules section, with one addition:\nWhen a player is eliminated, reduce the plan counter threshold by 1 for the remainder of the game. Victory Conditions linkThe game ends when only one player remains. That player is the winner. Alternative victory conditions may be introduced by specific card effects.\nMultiplayer-Specific Rules linkAll standard multiplayer rules apply to the Twin Suns format. For a complete overview of multiplayer rules, see the Multiplayer Rules section.\nStrategy Tips link Manage your plan counter carefully to maximize your turn’s effectiveness. Consider the increased base HP when planning your attacks. Be aware of the changing dynamics as players are eliminated and the plan counter threshold decreases. Frequently Asked Questions link Q: Can I choose not to advance the plan counter after an action? A: Yes, advancing the plan counter is optional after each action.\nQ: What happens if I reach the plan counter threshold in the middle of resolving an ability? A: Complete the resolution of the current ability, then end your turn.\nQ: How does the Twin Suns format affect card abilities that reference “opponents”? A: Unless otherwise specified, “opponents” refers to all other players in the game.\nFor more detailed information on multiplayer rules and interactions, please refer to the Glossary and other sections of the comprehensive rules.\n"
