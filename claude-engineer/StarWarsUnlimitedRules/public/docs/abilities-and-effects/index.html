<li>A triggered ability is considered to resolve during the same turn or game step that it was triggered. For more information on turn structure, see the <a href="/docs/turn-structure/">Turn Structure</a> section.</li>
<li>Resolving a triggered ability is not the same as taking an action. A player can resolve a triggered ability outside of their turn.</li>
<li>If an ability triggers during or as the result of a non-attack action, resolve that ability at the next available opportunity after that action is fully completed.</li>
<li>If an ability triggers during an attack, resolve that ability at the appropriate timing point within that attack.</li>
<li>If a player must resolve multiple triggered abilities on cards they control at the same time, that player chooses the order in which to resolve those abilities.</li>
<li>If both players must resolve triggered abilities on cards they control at the same time, the active player chooses one player at a time to resolve abilities. When chosen, that player resolves all abilities triggered on cards they control in the order of their choice, and once they finish, the other player does the same on cards they control.</li>
<li>After resolving a triggered ability &ldquo;A&rdquo;, if any new abilities were triggered while resolving it, the new abilities are considered &ldquo;nested abilities&rdquo; and must be resolved before any other abilities triggered at the same time as ability &ldquo;A&rdquo;.</li>

                content: "General linkA card’s type is located in the top left corner of the card. There are 6 different types of cards: bases, events, leaders, units, upgrades, and tokens.\nA “resource” is not a type of card, but a game object that a card becomes when placed in the resource zone.\nBase link Represents a location in Star Wars. Has a name, trait(s), HP value, and aspect icon. Some bases also have an ability. Each player’s deck must have exactly 1 base, which begins the game in its owner’s base zone. Can be damaged through abilities and enemy attacks. Some abilities heal damage from a base (e.g., Restore keyword). When a base has no remaining HP, its owner immediately loses the game. Event link Has a name, cost, trait(s), and ability. May also have aspect icons. To play: pay its cost, place it in the owner’s discard pile, then resolve its ability. Moves directly from hand to discard pile when played. Can affect itself if it affects cards in the discard pile. Leader link Double-sided card with a horizontal “Leader side” and a vertical “Leader Unit side.” Each side has two aspect icons, a name, subtitle, trait(s), and abilities. Each player’s deck must have exactly 1 leader, starting in the base zone on its Leader side. Deployed using the Epic Action ability on its Leader side. When defeated as a Leader Unit, it flips to its Leader side and moves to the owner’s base zone, exhausted. Unit link Depicts a Star Wars character or vehicle. Has a name, cost, power, HP, trait(s), and arena type. May have a subtitle, aspect icons, abilities, and a unique icon (⟡). Played by paying its cost and placing it in its designated arena (ground or space). Enters play exhausted and remains until defeated. Defeated when it has no remaining HP or by an ability. Upgrade link Attaches to a unit. Has a name, cost, trait(s), power modifier, and HP modifier. May have aspect icons, abilities, and a unique icon (⟡). Played by paying its cost and attaching it to a unit in play. May have specific attachment restrictions. Can be attached to friendly or enemy units. Defeated when the attached unit leaves play or by an ability. Token link Has a second type, such as “token upgrade.” Set aside at the start of the game. Cannot be shuffled into decks or discarded. No limit on tokens available to a player. Examples: Experience token: Gives +1 power and +1 HP to the attached unit. Shield token: Prevents the next instance of damage to the attached unit. Card Anatomy link Name: Top of the card (also bottom for upgrades) Subtitle: Under the name (if present) Card Type: Top left of the card Arena Type: Top right (for units) Cost: Top left corner (non-base cards) Aspects: Aspect icons on one side of the card Power: Left side of unit cards Power Modifier: Left side of upgrade cards HP: Right side of unit cards, top left of base cards HP Modifier: Right side of upgrade cards Traits: Under the name (events), under the art (units), or bottom (upgrades) Text Box: Contains card abilities Credit Line: Bottom of the card, with credit and set information For more detailed information on each card type and their interactions, please refer to the Glossary and other sections of the comprehensive rules.\n"

If a card has any printed abilities, they are found in the text box of that card.\nAn upgrade can give an ability to a unit if that upgrade indicates that the attached unit “gains” the ability; treat the unit as having the ability in its text box for as long as the upgrade is attached to it.\nUnless otherwise specified, a player controls the abilities on cards they play and control.\nAn effect is a non-cost part of a card ability that has the potential to change the game state. Some effects resolve separately from the ability that created them, or replace the standard resolution of the ability that created them.\nTypes of Abilities linkAction Abilities link An action ability is an ability indicated by the bolded word “Action.” Most action abilities have a cost in brackets that must be paid in order to use the ability. Using an action ability is one type of action a player can take during their turn. An Epic Action ability is a type of action ability that can only be used once per game. Constant Abilities link A constant ability is always in effect while the card it is on is in play. Constant abilities don’t have any special styling. A constant ability immediately comes into effect when the card it is on enters play and remains in effect while the card is in play. Some constant abilities continuously check the game for a specific condition to be met for their effects to apply to the game. These abilities usually include the word “while.” Constant abilities remain in effect even if the card they’re on is exhausted. Event Abilities link An event ability is an ability found in the text box of an event and is resolved when the event is played. When an event is played, it is placed in its owner’s discard pile before its ability resolves. An event ability must be resolved as completely as possible. Any part of the event ability that cannot be resolved is ignored. Keyword Abilities link A keyword or keyword ability is a card ability indicated with bold red text and that has specific associated rules. For more details, see the Keywords section. A keyword ability resolves automatically unless its definition includes the word “may.” If a card is given a keyword it already has, those keywords do not “stack” unless those keywords are followed by a numeral, a cost, or an em dash and ability text. Triggered Abilities link Triggered abilities have bold text indicating their triggering condition, starting with the word “When” or “On”, followed by a colon and an effect. For a triggered ability to resolve, the card with the ability must be in play when the triggering condition occurs, unless the ability specifies that it can be triggered from an out-of-play zone. A triggered ability must resolve once its triggering condition is met unless the ability uses the phrase “you may.” Effects linkLasting Effects link A lasting effect is a part of an ability that affects the game for a specified duration of time. Most lasting effects include the phrase “for this phase” or “for this attack.” A lasting effect persists beyond the resolution of the ability that created it and for the duration specified by the ability, even if the ability that created the effect was on a card that left play. Delayed Effects link A delayed effect is created when a card ability indicates a future timing point or a future condition that may arise and an effect that will happen at that time. Delayed effects resolve automatically and immediately after their specified timing point or future condition occurs, before any other abilities triggered by that timing point or condition. Replacement Effects link A replacement effect occurs when part or all of the standard resolution of a triggering condition or ability is replaced with an alternate resolution. This alternate resolution is the “replacement effect.” Replacement effects are indicated by the words “instead” or “would.” A replacement effect must be resolved immediately upon its condition being met, unless the effect uses the phrase “you may.” Resolving Abilities and Effects link When a player resolves an ability, they must resolve the effects of that ability in the order they are written. If an ability allows a player to choose some number of options, they may resolve those options in any order. If an ability that affects both players can be resolved simultaneously, resolve the ability simultaneously. Otherwise, the player that controls the card with the ability can choose the order in which each player is affected by the ability. Timing and Triggers link A triggered ability is considered to resolve during the same turn or game step that it was triggered. For more information on turn structure, see the Turn Structure section. Resolving a triggered ability is not the same as taking an action. A player can resolve a triggered ability outside of their turn. If an ability triggers during or as the result of a non-attack action, resolve that ability at the next available opportunity after that action is fully completed. If an ability triggers during an attack, resolve that ability at the appropriate timing point within that attack. If a player must resolve multiple triggered abilities on cards they control at the same time, that player chooses the order in which to resolve those abilities. If both players must resolve triggered abilities on cards they control at the same time, the active player chooses one player at a time to resolve abilities. When chosen, that player resolves all abilities triggered on cards they control in the order of their choice, and once they finish, the other player does the same on cards they control. After resolving a triggered ability “A”, if any new abilities were triggered while resolving it, the new abilities are considered “nested abilities” and must be resolved before any other abilities triggered at the same time as ability “A”. For more detailed information on specific abilities and their interactions, please refer to the Glossary and other sections of the comprehensive rules document.\n"

                content: "Overview linkThis section covers the fundamental concepts and rules for Star Wars Unlimited. Understanding these core mechanics is essential for gameplay.\nGeneral Concepts link Star Wars Unlimited is typically a two-player card game, with optional multiplayer rules. Players need one deck each, an initiative counter, damage counters, and token cards. Deck size varies by format, with specific requirements for leaders, bases, and other cards. Leaders and bases are part of a deck for deckbuilding but separate during gameplay. Tokens are not part of a player’s deck and don’t count toward deck size. Players may include cards from any aspect in their deck, potentially incurring aspect penalties. Golden Rules link Card text overrides general rules when in direct conflict. Resolve as much of an ability as possible, ignoring impossible parts. Restrictive abilities take precedence over permissive ones. Players and Active Player link The active player is currently taking an action. Players alternate being active during the action phase. The player with the initiative counter is considered active during non-action phases. Card Ownership and Control link Card owners are determined by initial deck composition. Controllers play, use, and affect cards they control. Control can change through specific card abilities. Ready and Exhausted States link Ready cards are upright; exhausted cards are sideways. Most cards enter play exhausted, with some exceptions. Cards ready through abilities or during the regroup phase. Exhausting is often a cost for actions or attacks. Defeating Cards link In-play cards can be defeated when meeting certain conditions: Bases: Damage equal to or greater than HP Units: Damage equal to or greater than HP or by direct abilities Upgrades: When attached unit leaves play or by direct abilities Tokens: Set aside when defeated Resources: Moved to discard pile when defeated Aspects and Unique Cards linkAspects linkThere are six aspects in Star Wars Unlimited:\nVigilance\nCommand\nAggression\nCunning\nVillainy\nHeroism\nAspect penalties apply when playing cards not matching leader/base aspects. The penalty is 2 additional resources per missing aspect icon. Unique Cards link Indicated by a ⟡ symbol before the name. Players can only control one copy of each unique card at a time. Resources and Costs link Resources are used to pay for cards and abilities. Costs are paid by exhausting ready resources. Players can add one resource per regroup phase. Some abilities allow additional resource placement. Card costs can be modified by abilities. Damage and HP link Damage is tracked with counters on cards with HP. Damage persists until healed or the card leaves play. Units are defeated when damage equals or exceeds HP. A player loses when their base’s damage equals or exceeds its HP. Power link Power determines a unit’s combat damage. Can be modified by upgrades and abilities. Cannot be reduced below 0. Game State link Encompasses all current game information. Players must change the game state on their turn (except when passing). Open and Hidden Information link Open information is available to all players (e.g., faceup cards, discard piles). Hidden information has restrictions (e.g., hand cards, deck order).

General Rules link A game consists of multiple rounds, each with an action phase and regroup phase. During the action phase, players alternate taking actions. During the regroup phase, players can put a resource into play and ready exhausted cards. Each step of setup and both phases must be completed in full unless otherwise specified. 2. Starting the Game and Setup linkPlayers set up the game following these steps in order:\nPut bases into play Put leaders into play Determine the first player Shuffle decks and draw opening hands Choose whether to mulligan Resource two cards Then, players start the first round with the first action phase.\n3. Round Structure link A round consists of two phases: action phase and regroup phase. The start of each action phase marks the beginning of a new game round. 4. Action Phase linkThe action phase consists of:\nStart of phase step Any number of player turns End of phase step Start of Action Phase link Expiring effects and triggered abilities resolve Player Turns link Players alternate taking one action at a time The player with the initiative counter goes first Available actions: Play a Card, Attack With a Unit, Use an Action Ability, Take the Initiative, or Pass End of Action Phase link Expiring effects and triggered abilities resolve 5.

Play A Card linkGeneral Rules link A player follows these steps when they choose to take the Play a Card action on their turn, or when they resolve an ability that lets them play a card as a nested action. To play a card, a player must have a card in their hand or be resolving an ability that allows them to play a card from another zone. A player may play a card whose ability has no effect, as long as the act of paying the costs for and playing the card changes the game state. Some action, event, and triggered abilities allow a player to play a card. Unless otherwise specified by the ability, the card must be played from the player’s hand, and the player must pay all costs of the card when playing it this way. Steps of Playing a Card link Declare intent Check restrictions Determine cost(s) Pay cost(s) Put card into play/discard After playing the card, resolve any “When Played” abilities on the card and any other abilities that triggered while playing and/or resolving the card, including Ambush and Shielded.\nAttack With A Unit linkGeneral Rules link A player follows these steps when they choose to take the Attack With a Unit action on their turn, or when they resolve an ability that lets them attack with a unit as a nested action. Only one unit may attack at a time, and only ready units may perform an attack, unless otherwise specified. “Combat damage” is damage dealt during the “Deal combat damage” step of an attack. Damage dealt outside of this step during an attack is not considered to be combat damage.

Multiplayer games can use decks created with either constructed or limited rules. Unless specified otherwise, all rules in the Comprehensive Rules apply to multiplayer formats. Gameplay Overview linkSetup linkSetting up a multiplayer game follows the same process as a two-player game, with one key difference:\nPlayers choose whether to take a mulligan in clockwise order, starting with the active player. For more details on game setup, see the Setup and Victory section.\nArenas linkIn multiplayer games:\nEach player has their own portion of the ground and space arenas in their play area. A player’s arena portions are on either side of their base zone. All players’ arena portions are considered part of the larger arena. Turn Structure link The player with initiative is the first active player. Play proceeds clockwise, with each player becoming the active player and taking an action. This continues until all players pass consecutively, ending the action phase. For more information on turn structure, see the Turn Structure section.\nPlayer Elimination linkA player is eliminated when their base has no remaining HP. When this happens:\nThe eliminated player can no longer take actions. All cards they own are removed from play. Cards owned by other players in their play area go to their owners’ discard piles. Their triggered abilities waiting to resolve are ignored. Lasting effects or delayed effects they created remain active. If they controlled the initiative counter, it returns to the center of the play area. notifications Eliminated players cannot be brought back into the game. Their base cannot be healed, and they cannot be affected by abilities. Additional Rules link Players may discuss the game freely, but deals between players are not binding. For card abilities, a player’s “opponent” is any other player in the game. Abilities affecting multiple players resolve simultaneously when possible. Otherwise, the ability’s controller chooses the order. Sentinel only protects its controller’s units and base, not those of other players.
