# Star Wars Unlimited: Setup and Victory Conditions

Understanding the setup process and victory conditions is crucial for playing Star Wars Unlimited. This section covers the rules for two-player constructed formats, including game setup and how to win the game.

## General Rules

1. Star Wars Unlimited offers several game formats, defined by player count and deckbuilding method:
   - Two-player constructed (Premier format)
   - Multiplayer constructed (see [Multiplayer Rules](multiplayer-rules.md))
   - Limited formats (e.g., draft, sealed)
2. A "constructed" format allows players to build decks ahead of time from their card collection.
3. Unless otherwise specified, all rules in the Comprehensive Rules apply to all formats.

## Deck Construction

### Premier Format

The premier format is the standard two-player constructed format for Star Wars Unlimited. Two-player starter decks follow these rules:

1. Deck size: Minimum of 52 cards
2. Card limits:
   - Exactly 1 [leader](card-types.md#4-leader)
   - Exactly 1 [base](card-types.md#2-base)
   - A minimum of 50 other cards (consisting of [units](card-types.md#5-unit), [events](card-types.md#3-event), and [upgrades](card-types.md#6-upgrade))
   - Maximum of 3 copies of any individual unit, event, or upgrade

## Game Setup

The basic steps for setting up a two-player game of Star Wars Unlimited are:

1. Shuffle your deck and place it face-down in your play area.
2. Place your leader and base cards face-up in their designated zones.
3. Draw your starting hand of 5 cards.
4. Decide who goes first (usually by rolling a die or flipping a coin).
5. The player going second draws an additional card.

For a detailed, step-by-step guide to game setup, please refer to the [Turn Structure](turn-structure.md#setup-phase) section.

## Victory Conditions

The primary way to win a game of Star Wars Unlimited is to reduce your opponent's base to 0 HP. However, there are additional victory conditions:

1. If a player has no cards in their deck and cannot draw when required to do so, they lose the game.
2. If a player controls no cards in play (including their base) at the end of any phase, they lose the game.
3. Some card effects may create alternative win conditions.

For more details on winning the game and resolving simultaneous win/loss conditions, see the [Player Actions](player-actions.md#winning-and-losing) section.
