# Twin Suns Format

The Twin Suns format is a unique multiplayer variant for Star Wars Unlimited, designed to create exciting and balanced gameplay for 3-6 players. This section covers the specific rules and mechanics of the Twin Suns format.

## Overview

Twin Suns is a multiplayer format that introduces new elements to the standard Star Wars Unlimited gameplay:

1. A plan counter to manage turn structure
2. Modified victory conditions
3. Unique player interactions

## Setup

Follow the standard multiplayer setup as described in the [Multiplayer Rules](/docs/multiplayer-rules/#setup) section, with these additions:

1. Place the plan counter in the center of the play area.
2. Each player starts with 40 base HP instead of the standard 30.

## Turn Structure

The Twin Suns format modifies the standard turn structure:

1. The active player takes actions as normal.
2. After each action, the active player may choose to advance the plan counter.
3. When the plan counter reaches a specific threshold (based on player count), the active player's turn ends.
4. Play passes to the next player clockwise.

For more details on the standard turn structure, see the [Turn Structure](/docs/turn-structure/) section.

## Plan Counter

The plan counter is a unique element of the Twin Suns format:

1. It starts at 0 at the beginning of each player's turn.
2. The active player may advance it by 1 after each action they take.
3. When it reaches the threshold, the active player's turn ends immediately.
4. The threshold is determined by the number of players:
   - 3-4 players: 5
   - 5-6 players: 4

## Player Elimination

Player elimination follows the standard rules as described in the [Multiplayer Rules](/docs/multiplayer-rules/#player-elimination) section, with one addition:

- When a player is eliminated, reduce the plan counter threshold by 1 for the remainder of the game.

## Victory Conditions

The game ends when only one player remains. That player is the winner. Alternative victory conditions may be introduced by specific card effects.

## Multiplayer-Specific Rules

All standard multiplayer rules apply to the Twin Suns format. For a complete overview of multiplayer rules, see the [Multiplayer Rules](/docs/multiplayer-rules/) section.

## Strategy Tips

1. Manage your plan counter carefully to maximize your turn's effectiveness.
2. Consider the increased base HP when planning your attacks.
3. Be aware of the changing dynamics as players are eliminated and the plan counter threshold decreases.

## Frequently Asked Questions

1. Q: Can I choose not to advance the plan counter after an action?
   A: Yes, advancing the plan counter is optional after each action.

2. Q: What happens if I reach the plan counter threshold in the middle of resolving an ability?
   A: Complete the resolution of the current ability, then end your turn.

3. Q: How does the Twin Suns format affect card abilities that reference "opponents"?
