# Player Actions in Star Wars Unlimited

Understanding player actions is crucial for mastering Star Wars Unlimited. This section provides detailed explanations and timing charts for the core actions: Play a Card, Attack With a Unit, and Use an Action Ability.

{{< alert context="info" >}}
For each type of action, perform each step in order and as completely as possible. Resolve any triggered abilities between steps before proceeding.

## Play A Card

### General Rules

1. A player follows these steps when they choose to take the Play a Card action on their turn, or when they resolve an ability that lets them play a card as a nested action.
2. To play a card, a player must have a card in their [hand](game-zones.md#7-hand) or be resolving an ability that allows them to play a card from another zone.
3. A player may play a card whose ability has no effect, as long as the act of paying the costs for and playing the card changes the game state.
4. Some action, event, and triggered abilities allow a player to play a card. Unless otherwise specified by the ability, the card must be played from the player's hand, and the player must pay all costs of the card when playing it this way.
5. [Aspect penalties](game-concepts.md#7-aspects-and-unique-cards) apply when playing cards, unless otherwise specified.

### Steps of Playing a Card

1. Declare intent: Announce the card you intend to play.
2. Check restrictions: Ensure you can legally play the card (e.g., correct arena, unique restrictions).
3. Determine cost(s): Calculate the total cost, including any modifiers or penalties.
4. Pay cost(s): Exhaust the required number of resources.
5. Put card into play/discard: Place the card in the appropriate zone based on its type.

After playing the card, resolve any "When Played" abilities on the card and any other abilities that triggered while playing and/or resolving the card, including [Ambush](keywords.md#a-ambush) and [Shielded](keywords.md#i-shielded).

### Example

Alice wants to play "Luke Skywalker" from her hand. She declares her intent, checks that she has no other unique "Luke Skywalker" in play, determines the cost (including any aspect penalties), exhausts the required resources, and places Luke in her ground arena. She then resolves Luke's "When Played" ability.

## Attack With A Unit

### General Rules

1. A player follows these steps when they choose to take the Attack With a Unit action on their turn, or when they resolve an ability that lets them attack with a unit as a nested action.
2. Only one [unit](card-types.md#5-unit) may attack at a time, and only ready units may perform an attack, unless otherwise specified.
3. "Combat damage" is damage dealt during the "Deal combat damage" step of an attack. Damage dealt outside of this step during an attack is not considered to be combat damage.
4. The attacking player chooses a target for the attack. This can be an opponent's unit in the same arena or the opponent's base if there are no units in that arena.

### Steps of Attacking With a Unit

1. Declare the attack: Choose an attacking unit and a target.
2. Deal combat damage: Both the attacker and defender (if a unit) deal their power in damage simultaneously.
3. Complete the attack: Resolve any effects that trigger "after an attack" or "when a unit is defeated".

After each step, resolve any abilities triggered during that step before proceeding to the next step in the attack.

### Example

Bob attacks Alice's base with his X-wing (power 3). He declares the attack, then deals 3 damage to Alice's base. After the attack, Bob's X-wing exhausts.

## Use an Action Ability

### General Rules

1. A player follows these steps when they choose to take the Use an Action Ability action on their turn, or when they resolve an ability that lets them use an action ability as a nested action.
2. Action abilities are abilities that begin with the bold word "Action" or "Epic Action" followed by a cost in brackets, a colon, and an ability following the colon. For more details on abilities, see the [Abilities and Effects](abilities-and-effects.md) section.
3. To use an action ability, a player must be able to pay the ability's cost if it has one and change the game state through paying that ability's cost and/or resolving that ability's effect.
4. A player can only use action abilities on cards they control, unless otherwise specified.

### Steps of Using an Action Ability

1. Declare intent: Announce which action ability you intend to use.
2. Check restrictions: Ensure you can legally use the ability.
3. Determine cost(s): Identify any costs associated with the ability.
4. Pay cost(s): Pay any required costs (e.g., exhausting the card, discarding cards).
5. Resolve the ability: Carry out the effect of the ability.

After using the action ability, resolve any abilities that triggered while using the action ability.

### Example

Charlie uses the action ability on his "Millennium Falcon" card: "Action [exhaust]: Ready another unit you control." He declares his intent, checks that the Millennium Falcon is ready, exhausts it as the cost, then chooses another of his exhausted units to ready.

## Action Restrictions and Special Cases

1. Players cannot take actions between the time an ability is activated and the time it resolves, except when responding to a nested action.
2. Some abilities allow players to take actions at unusual times, such as during an opponent's turn. These exceptions are always explicitly stated on the card.
3. If an ability allows a player to "take an additional action," they may choose any of the standard actions (Play a Card, Attack With a Unit, Use an Action Ability) or pass.
