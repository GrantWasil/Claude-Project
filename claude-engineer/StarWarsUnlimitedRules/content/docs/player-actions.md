{{< /alert >}}

## Play A Card

### General Rules

1. A player follows these steps when they choose to take the Play a Card action on their turn, or when they resolve an ability that lets them play a card as a nested action.
2. To play a card, a player must have a card in their [hand](game-zones.md#7-hand) or be resolving an ability that allows them to play a card from another zone.
3. A player may play a card whose ability has no effect, as long as the act of paying the costs for and playing the card changes the game state.
4. Some action, event, and triggered abilities allow a player to play a card. Unless otherwise specified by the ability, the card must be played from the player's hand, and the player must pay all costs of the card when playing it this way.

### Steps of Playing a Card

1. Declare intent
2. Check restrictions
3. Determine cost(s)
4. Pay cost(s)
5. Put card into play/discard

After playing the card, resolve any "When Played" abilities on the card and any other abilities that triggered while playing and/or resolving the card, including [Ambush](keywords.md#a-ambush) and [Shielded](keywords.md#i-shielded).

## Attack With A Unit

### General Rules

1. A player follows these steps when they choose to take the Attack With a Unit action on their turn, or when they resolve an ability that lets them attack with a unit as a nested action.
2. Only one [unit](card-types.md#5-unit) may attack at a time, and only ready units may perform an attack, unless otherwise specified.
3. "Combat damage" is damage dealt during the "Deal combat damage" step of an attack. Damage dealt outside of this step during an attack is not considered to be combat damage.

### Steps of Attacking With a Unit

1. Declare the attack
2. Deal combat damage
3. Complete the attack

After each step, resolve any abilities triggered during that step before proceeding to the next step in the attack.

## Use an Action Ability

### General Rules

1. A player follows these steps when they choose to take the Use an Action Ability action on their turn, or when they resolve an ability that lets them use an action ability as a nested action.
2. Action abilities are abilities that begin with the bold word "Action" or "Epic Action" followed by a cost in brackets, a colon, and an ability following the colon. For more details on abilities, see the [Abilities and Effects](abilities-and-effects.md) section.
3. To use an action ability, a player must be able to pay the ability's cost if it has one and change the game state through paying that ability's cost and/or resolving that ability's effect.

### Steps of Using an Action Ability

1. Declare intent
2. Check restrictions
3. Determine cost(s)
4. Pay cost(s)
5. Resolve the ability

After using the action ability, resolve any abilities that triggered while using the action ability.
