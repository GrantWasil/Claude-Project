# Multiplayer Rules

This section covers the rules for playing Star Wars Unlimited with more than two players.

## General Rules

1. Star Wars Unlimited can be played with three or more players using multiplayer formats.
2. Multiplayer games can use decks created with either constructed or limited rules.
3. Unless specified otherwise, all rules in the Comprehensive Rules apply to multiplayer formats.

## Gameplay Overview

### Setup

Setting up a multiplayer game follows the same process as a two-player game, with one key difference:

- Players choose whether to take a mulligan in clockwise order, starting with the active player.

For more details on game setup, see the [Setup and Victory](setup-and-victory.md) section.

### Arenas

In multiplayer games:

- Each player has their own portion of the ground and space arenas in their play area.
- A player's arena portions are on either side of their base zone.
- All players' arena portions are considered part of the larger arena.

### Turn Structure

1. The player with initiative is the first active player.
2. Play proceeds clockwise, with each player becoming the active player and taking an action.
3. This continues until all players pass consecutively, ending the action phase.

For more information on turn structure, see the [Turn Structure](turn-structure.md) section.

## Player Elimination

A player is eliminated when their base has no remaining HP. When this happens:

1. The eliminated player can no longer take actions.
2. All cards they own are removed from play.
3. Cards owned by other players in their play area go to their owners' [discard piles](game-zones.md#discard-pile).
4. Their triggered abilities waiting to resolve are ignored.
5. [Lasting effects or delayed effects](abilities-and-effects.md#3-effects) they created remain active.
6. If they controlled the initiative counter, it returns to the center of the play area.

Eliminated players cannot be brought back into the game. Their base cannot be healed, and they cannot be affected by abilities.

## Additional Rules

- Players may discuss the game freely, but deals between players are not binding.
- For card abilities, a player's "opponent" is any other player in the game.
- Abilities affecting multiple players resolve simultaneously when possible. Otherwise, the ability's controller chooses the order.
- [Sentinel](keywords.md#sentinel) only protects its controller's units and base, not those of other players.
