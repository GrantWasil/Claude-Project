# Multiplayer Rules

Star Wars Unlimited is not just limited to one-on-one battles. This section covers the rules for playing with three or more players, offering exciting new dynamics and strategies to explore.

## General Rules

1. Star Wars Unlimited can be played with three or more players using multiplayer formats.
2. Multiplayer games can use decks created with either [constructed](deck-construction.md#constructed-deck-rules) or [limited](deck-construction.md#limited-deck-rules) rules.
3. Unless specified otherwise, all rules in the Comprehensive Rules apply to multiplayer formats.
4. The recommended player count for multiplayer games is 3-6 players.
5. Each player starts with 30 base HP, regardless of the number of players.

## Player Interaction

1. Players may discuss the game freely, but deals between players are not binding.
2. Table talk is allowed and encouraged, but players cannot show their hands to each other.
3. Players may not share resources or cards unless an ability specifically allows it.

## Gameplay Overview

### Setup

Setting up a multiplayer game follows the same process as a two-player game, with these key differences:

1. Determine seating order randomly.
2. Players choose whether to take a mulligan in clockwise order, starting with the active player.
3. The initiative counter starts in the center of the play area.

For more details on game setup, see the [Setup and Victory](setup-and-victory.md) section.

### Arenas

In multiplayer games:

1. Each player has their own portion of the ground and space arenas in their play area.
2. A player's arena portions are on either side of their base zone.
3. All players' arena portions are considered part of the larger arena.
4. Units can attack any other player's units or base, regardless of their position in the arena.

### Turn Structure

1. The player with initiative is the first active player.
2. Play proceeds clockwise, with each player becoming the active player and taking an action.
3. This continues until all players pass consecutively, ending the action phase.
4. After the action phase, proceed to the [end phase](turn-structure.md#3-end-phase) as normal.

For more information on turn structure, see the [Turn Structure](turn-structure.md) section.

## Player Elimination

A player is eliminated when their base has no remaining HP. When this happens:

1. The eliminated player can no longer take actions or make decisions.
2. All cards they own are removed from play.
3. Cards owned by other players in their play area go to their owners' [discard piles](game-zones.md#discard-pile).
4. Their triggered abilities waiting to resolve are ignored.
5. [Lasting effects or delayed effects](abilities-and-effects.md#3-effects) they created remain active for their specified duration.
6. If they controlled the initiative counter, it returns to the center of the play area.
7. The game continues with the remaining players.

Eliminated players cannot be brought back into the game. Their base cannot be healed, and they cannot be affected by abilities.

## Multiplayer-Specific Keywords

While most keywords function the same in multiplayer games, some have specific implications:

1. [Sentinel](keywords.md#sentinel): Only protects its controller's units and base, not those of other players.
2. [Overwhelm](keywords.md#overwhelm): Excess damage is still dealt only to the defending player's base.
3. [Restore](keywords.md#restore): The controller chooses which of their bases to heal.

## Frequently Asked Questions

1. Q: Can I attack multiple players in one turn?
   A: Yes, you can attack different players with different units, as long as each unit only attacks once per turn.

2. Q: How does [Bounty](keywords.md#bounty) work in multiplayer?
   A: The player who defeats or captures the unit with Bounty resolves the Bounty effect, regardless of who owns the unit.

3. Q: Can I use abilities that target "an opponent" on any player?
   A: Yes, in multiplayer games, "an opponent" refers to any other player in the game.
