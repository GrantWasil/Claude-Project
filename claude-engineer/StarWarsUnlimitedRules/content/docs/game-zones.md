## Overview

Game zones are defined areas in Star Wars Unlimited with specific rules. Understanding these zones is crucial for gameplay. This section covers the seven different types of zones and their characteristics.

## Types of Zones

1. Base Zone
2. Ground Arena
3. Space Arena
4. Resource Zone
5. Deck
6. Hand
7. Discard Pile

The ground and space arenas are shared between players, while the other zones are separate for each player.

## Base Zone

- Located in the center of each player's play area
- Contains the player's [base](card-types.md#2-base) and [leader](card-types.md#4-leader) at the start of the game
- Bases always remain in this zone
- Leaders move between this zone and the ground arena

## Ground Arena

- Shared zone located next to each player's base zone
- Contains ground [units](card-types.md#5-unit)
- Units face their controller when ready
- Ground units can attack enemy ground units and the enemy base

## Space Arena

- Shared zone located next to each player's base zone
- Contains space [units](card-types.md#5-unit)
- Units face their controller when ready
- Space units can attack enemy space units and the enemy base

## Resource Zone

- Each player has their own resource zone
- Contains facedown cards called "resources"
- Resources can be exhausted to pay costs
- Players can add one card from their hand to this zone during each [regroup phase](turn-structure.md#1-regroup-phase)

## Deck

- Each player's deck is its own zone
- Cards are facedown and out of play by default
- Cards leave the deck when drawn, discarded, or played directly

## Hand

- Each player's hand is a private zone
- No limit on the number of cards in hand
- Cards in hand are hidden information from opponents
- The number of cards in hand is open information

## Discard Pile

- Each player's discard pile is its own zone
- Contains faceup cards that have been played, defeated, or discarded
- Open information that can be viewed by any player
- Order of cards does not need to be maintained

## Additional Concepts

### In-Play and Out-of-Play Zones

- In-play zones: Base Zone, Ground Arena, Space Arena, Resource Zone
- Out-of-play zones: Deck, Hand, Discard Pile

### Play Area

- Consists of cards a player controls in in-play zones
- Excludes upgrades controlled by a player but attached to enemy units

### Set Aside/No Zone

- Cards set aside are out-of-play and not in any zone
- [Token](card-types.md#7-token) cards begin set aside and enter play through abilities
