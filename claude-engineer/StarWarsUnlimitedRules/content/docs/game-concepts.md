## Overview

This section covers the fundamental concepts and rules for Star Wars Unlimited. Understanding these core mechanics is essential for gameplay.

## General Concepts

- Star Wars Unlimited is typically a two-player card game, with optional [multiplayer rules](/docs/multiplayer-rules/).
- Players need one deck each, an initiative counter, damage counters, and token cards.
- Deck size varies by format, with specific requirements for leaders, bases, and other cards.
- Leaders and bases are part of a deck for deckbuilding but separate during gameplay.
- Tokens are not part of a player's deck and don't count toward deck size.
- Players may include cards from any aspect in their deck, potentially incurring aspect penalties.

## Golden Rules

1. Card text overrides general rules when in direct conflict.
2. Resolve as much of an ability as possible, ignoring impossible parts.
3. Restrictive abilities take precedence over permissive ones.

## Players and Active Player

- The active player is currently taking an action.
- Players alternate being active during the [action phase](/docs/turn-structure/#action-phase).
- The player with the initiative counter is considered active during non-action phases.

## Card Ownership and Control

- Card owners are determined by initial deck composition.
- Controllers play, use, and affect cards they control.
- Control can change through specific card abilities.

## Ready and Exhausted States

- Ready cards are upright; exhausted cards are sideways.
- Most cards enter play exhausted, with some exceptions.
- Cards ready through abilities or during the regroup phase.
- Exhausting is often a cost for actions or attacks.

## Defeating Cards

- In-play cards can be defeated when meeting certain conditions:
  - Bases: Damage equal to or greater than HP
  - Units: Damage equal to or greater than HP or by direct abilities
  - Upgrades: When attached unit leaves play or by direct abilities
  - Tokens: Set aside when defeated
  - Resources: Moved to discard pile when defeated

## Aspects and Unique Cards

### Aspects

There are six aspects in Star Wars Unlimited:

![Vigilance](https://swudb.com/images/Vigilance.png) Vigilance
![Command](https://swudb.com/images/Command.png) Command
![Aggression](https://swudb.com/images/Aggression.png) Aggression
![Cunning](https://swudb.com/images/Cunning.png) Cunning
![Villainy](https://swudb.com/images/Villainy.png) Villainy
![Heroism](https://swudb.com/images/Heroism.png) Heroism

- Aspect penalties apply when playing cards not matching leader/base aspects.
- The penalty is 2 additional resources per missing aspect icon.

### Unique Cards

- Indicated by a ‚ü° symbol before the name.
- Players can only control one copy of each unique card at a time.

## Resources and Costs

- Resources are used to pay for cards and abilities.
- Costs are paid by exhausting ready resources.
- Players can add one resource per regroup phase.
- Some abilities allow additional resource placement.
- Card costs can be modified by abilities.

## Damage and HP

- Damage is tracked with counters on cards with HP.
- Damage persists until healed or the card leaves play.
- Units are defeated when damage equals or exceeds HP.
- A player loses when their base's damage equals or exceeds its HP.

## Power

- Power determines a unit's combat damage.
- Can be modified by upgrades and abilities.
- Cannot be reduced below 0.

## Game State

- Encompasses all current game information.
- Players must change the game state on their turn (except when passing).

## Open and Hidden Information

- Open information is available to all players (e.g., faceup cards, discard piles).
- Hidden information has restrictions (e.g., hand cards, deck order).

## Arenas

- Two types: Ground and Space.
- Units are played into a specific arena.
- Some abilities can move units between arenas.

## Initiative

- Determines the first player in various game phases.
- Can change through card abilities or game effects.

## Timing and Priority

- Follows a specific order for resolving abilities and effects.
- Active player generally has priority to act first.

## Aspect Penalty
The aspect penalty is a special modifier to a card's cost. When a player attempts to play a card with aspect icons beyond those provided by that player's leader and/or base, the player incurs the aspect penalty, and must pay 2 additional resources for each icon beyond those provided.

## Initiative Counter
The initiative counter is used to keep track of which player has the initiative in the game. The player who starts a round with the initiative counter is the first active player for that round and takes the first action in that round.
